Alle sind in Panik und meine Schwester liegt mir in den Ohren, dass ich über meinen Schatten springen und nach vielen Jahren mal wieder nach Hause fahren soll. Unser Verhältnis war nämlich nicht so toll in den letzten Jahren. Das werden wir wohl möglichst noch reparieren müssen.

Das eigentliche Problem an der Geschichte ist, dass ich am Wochenende Begleitung auf einer Hochzeitsfeier sein soll. Da müsste ich sehr kurzfristig absagen, denn anders würde ich das zeitlich nicht koordiniert bekommen. Ich würde dann eine Freundin im Regen stehen lassen, und ihre Freundin (die Braut) ist jetzt schon Bridezilla und würde ihr das wohl nicht verzeihen.

Vorschläge meinerseits sind, dass meine Freundin eine Vertretung mitnimmt (eine andere Freundin), oder ich so fahre, dass ich zwar die Kirche vormittags verpasse, aber dann ab nachmittags dabei bin. Das kam aber beides nicht gut an.

**I. Am. Gay.** 

  
I've known that I was for so.... so long, every since I was probably a kid. I would always stare at the hot Abercrombie models and would literally dream about them appearing in my room at night to take me in their arms. I'm always catching myself staring at men, preferably their arms & biceps. 

I come from a long line of shameful parents who expect me to one day get a girlfriend and provide them with kids & shower them with money. Sadly enough, I don't know if I'll ever be able to deliver them their hopes and dreams to bring in a girl. Their expectations weigh on me every single second of my life and I dread the idea of one day.... whenever that is or if that will ever happen.... that I end up breaking and just falling deep, deep into depression. 

Anxiety. I'm sure everyone has it, mine just keeps me nauseous, fearful and trembling... no biggie haha. It doesn't help that I have to keep myself from seeming gay in front of family and friends but I do what I must to stay emotionally & psychologically safe.

I enjoy playing gay/nsfw/bara visual novel games secretly and often obsess/daydream about wishing to be born in those worlds where finding love would be as easy and straight forward (plus their all so hot lol). 

I never actually thought I would be doing something like this on reddit, coming out that is haha but I'm at a point in my life where all I really want is change, albeit rather slowly and or secretively. I'm introverted to the max and I guess I'm just looking for some way to let a little bit of myself out.

Pasa que desde Febrero me estaba conociendo con una chava, todo normal, saliamos seguido o nos veiamos en lugares publicos, hablabamos casi a diario y todo normal. Aunque aun no pasaba nada mas de vernos o darnos un beso de ''pico''

Hace ya, cerca de 3 semanas, me estaba presionando para que nos vieramos (a hacer el sin respeto), pero yo de verdad no podia, trabajo toda la semana y meti 5 clases en la u, asique de 6 a 9 y todo sabado y domingo hasta la tarde lo paso en la U. Aparte que estuve lesionado de una rodilla el mes pasado. Y era una insistidera exagerada. Al punto que la semana pasada llego a la u un martes (no estamos en la misma u) para que nos fueramos juntos esa noche a hacer el sin respeto.

Y yo le dije ''vaya hagamos algo pues, veamonos el sabado y hagamonos examen de ets mañana'' y ella se nego exagerado, que la estaba acusando de algo y eso, yo le explique que nada que ver, solo que por bienestar de ambos me gusta chequearme antes de nada, y que igual yo pagaba todo.  
Pero cero, no queria. Entonces waos eso fue bien sospechoso para mi, yo le dije que si era asi no me sentia muy comodo.

Y luego solto la sopa. Me pregunto:

>¿Pero esas pruebas traen prueba de embarazo?

.\_\_\_\_\_.) Y bueno, la quede viendo con cara de ''For real?''

>¿Estas viendote con otra persona?

Y nada, me solto todo, se vio con un amigo del trabajo, y como que se vieron, paso lo que paso, el man se habia ido del pais al poco tiempo de estar con ella. Ella tenia un mes de retraso y la prueba ya le habia dado positivo.

Estaba embarazada de aquel man.

I used to go to the gym regularly, but since January it’s been closed due to storm damage (the roof literally flew off!). So lately I’ve been relying on Apple Fitness+ workouts at home, and I really enjoy them — especially the trainers and the overall vibe. I’ve been doing Pilates, yoga, some cycling (I have a basic foldable bike), and the occasional core session. It’s been helping me feel more energized and back in my clothes!

Now, my options are:

* A month of free outdoor fitness classes in my city, but unfortunately they take place right when my daughter gets home from her summer activities after 8 hours away. I’d rather spend that time with her and work out when she’s busy.
* A gym right under my apartment offers only group classes, but each class costs €12 (about $13) — not exactly budget-friendly if I want to go regularly.
* Or… I could renew Apple Fitness+, which gives me structure and flexibility, and honestly feels like a friendly community thanks to the trainers.

I do miss the in-person atmosphere of a real gym, but Apple Fitness+ has really worked for me in this chaotic season of life.

What would you do? Has anyone else renewed it long-term and felt it was worth it?

Thanks in advance! 😊

**Sarah Maas:** “Read ACOTAR first [before Crescent City]. I do not stand by any standalone statements. **I DENOUNCE the standalone statement.”**

💜Bryce Quinlan: “World-walkers…You are one of them. So were Helena and Theia. Their natural abilities lent themselves to moving through the mists.”

“Didn’t you hear? *I’m a fancy world-walker* who can do this shit innately.”

🌟Second slide: Bryce’s star! A pin SJM had saved in both her old CC folder (Bryce!), and *Twilight of the Gods.*

🌟Elizabeth Evans recently re-recorded the ACOTAR audiobooks as part of the anniversary of the series — she is the narrator for Crescent City, Throne of Glass, and now, ACOTAR. Perhaps SJM needed them done by the same narrator for a crossover next ACOTAR and for future crossovers? Though not officially confirmed what it will be about — we know a new series is coming (following the next ACOTAR), and we know, “it will be very emotional for [SJM] to write because of the world and characters [she’ll] be writing in.”

🌟Outside of textual evidence from her current three series, we have confirmation from Bloomsbury that SJM has a new series coming out — and she only had one, unpublished book Pinterest board…

[The Memorial recently acquired Kate... - Australian War Memorial | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AWMemorial/posts/pfbid0DPdWrBkwapFwpbcrJ8UoPGYTwwfmd1qHJQsVE4Miz5VA5PVW766ijv98BPqmZzypl)

The Memorial recently acquired Kate Stevens’ painting ‘The Mission (redacted) no.2’, a scene from April 2012 with Australian army helicopters leaving a base in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan on a Special Forces mission. 

The blue ‘redaction’ recalls those of the public release version of the Afghanistan Inquiry Report by Assistant Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force (IGADF) NSW Supreme Court Justice and Army Reserve Major General the Honourable Paul Brereton, AM, RFD. Events that took place on some of the missions such as this one are now under investigation for alleged war crimes. Stevens selected this mission to paint as it was reportedly uneventful.

Stevens, based in Braidwood NSW, explores Australia’s military history, war art, and globalised conflicts in her art practice. She has painted scenes sourced from the technologies – such as drones, media, mobile phones and helmet cameras - which record and transmit war to civilians far from the frontline.Caption: Kate Stevens’ The Mission (redacted) no.2 (2024, oil on canvas, 100 x 125cm) AWM2025.316.1

2025-06-04 04:50:00,"Rate my marketability?. I started this role in mid May with no prior construction experience and will be working to mid fall on a multi million dollar remote heavy civil highway project in Alaska. The schedule is demanding with 10 to 14 hour days six days a week and the learning curve has been steep. Since starting I’ve taken on responsibilities like tracking daily production quantities managing labor and equipment time sheets and assisting in preparing biweekly payment submissions to the state. I’ve also started helping with SWPPP compliance through BMP documentation and erosion control reporting. The remote nature of the project has given me early exposure to fast paced high responsibility field work.

I’ve been fortunate to work under a supervisor who’s been patient and supportive from day one. They’ve trusted me with meaningful responsibilities while also taking the time to teach and guide me through unfamiliar systems. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn directly from someone with experience and I’ve been doing my best to help reduce their workload by taking full ownership of the tasks I’ve been assigned. My goal is to continue stepping up wherever I can so they can focus on the bigger picture items that drive the project forward.

Looking ahead over the next two weeks I expect to complete a full payment cycle submission continue expanding my role in SWPPP tracking and develop more familiarity with cost reporting and production forecasting tools. I’m curious how this type of hands on field experience earned within a few months on a remote project might be viewed by general contractors in the lower 48 especially those working on/for data centers, sports facilities or large scale infrastructure. For someone who came into the role without a construction background would this kind of accelerated exposure help when applying for project engineer positions elsewhere?",0.14911330049261082,4,False,1

2025-06-04 04:49:59,"Still early in One Piece and already think it’s one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. So I’m a 30 year old man who used to never give this show a chance as a kid. When I was watching toonami and adult swim I watched for inuyasha and dragon ball z but as soon as I saw Luffy and that big smile of his for some reason I was just turned off to the show and just didn’t want to see it (perhaps I couldn’t understand luffy’s optimism and carefree attitude) maybe it just seemed childish, which I still think it can be, but I instantly turned it off or switched to something else as soon as I saw luffy (and also yasuke from yuyu hakusho (which I also regret not getting into back then))

Anyway I’m now 30 and unemployed with a bunch of time on my hands and I’ve gotten to the enies lobby arc from episode like 25 or something in the past couple months and it’s just been great. The writing in this show while it has its problems and juvenile moments I’m still not crazy on the actual story is incredible and there’s just so much to love. Incredible themes and I absolutely love every one of the strawhats and most of the characters in general. Oda is an absolute genius, I want to read the manga for the art, and I know later on it helps with the pacing, but fuck I love the music and the animation especially as it’s now getting better and the voice acting (I watch dub but I’ve heard the original Japanese language version and all of them still sound great especially luffy both respective VAs absolutely knock it out of the park 

One of the biggest things I love is his obvious care for animals, and how Oda shows their stories. Same goes with the humans and I guess monsters n creatures too for lack of a better word. Just incredible characters and just when you think he must be out of ideas the next guy is more ridiculous or girl more hot 😂 than the last. I don’t want to only give him credit cause I do mainly watch the anime and the teams there do work really hard but yeah he knows how to make you laugh and cry in the same episode some multiple times in the same episode and these are frequent. Just great.

I know it’s not perfect and i get I’ll get called corny for going on so much about this but fuck I love this show and just wanted to say all that stuff.

2025-06-04 04:49:59,"No Faculty Wants to Chair My Committee. Hello!

  
This is part rant part I need advice. I started my sociology PhD back in 2016 and after two and a half years I took a really long leave of absence. I returned this fall (2024) and my research interests had changed substantially, so even though I returned to my original advisor we both knew the fit was not right and I would have to find a different advisor/dissertation committee chair by the end of the year.

I worked hard on branching out, as a lot of new faculty had joined the department while I was gone. I found a really amazing mentor and our research aligned, but in the middle of winter quarter I found out she was going to a different university. I then pivoted to another professor and worked well with her. Well, towards the middle of spring quarter I asked if she could chair my dissertation committee as we use the same methods, but she said no because she does not know my literature well. I asked a second professor with whom I had taken a workshop all year and knows my work (he also uses the same methods) and he also said no because he doesn't know my literature.

I reached out to a professor who will be returning from sabbatical in the fall and she was excited about my project and agreed to be on the committee but my OG advisor had told me not to ask her to chair until I had more of an opportunity to develop a relationship with her, so I asked the one professor if I could put him down as chair while I developed a relationship with the returning professor because we have to turn in a form with our committee members by the end of summer and he said no.

I'm feeling really discouraged because logistically I don't know what happens if I don't turn in this form. But on a spiritual level I just feel super discouraged that no one wants to chair or advise me. I feel really insecure about my project and how I come off as a scholar since no one wants to take on the responsibility of having me as an advisee, and this year I was so adrift and had to rely on my grad student friends for professional advice but I just see how they have really supportive advisors and it makes me sad that I have to do all of this so alone. I already left the program once and I am really motivated to finish this time but I wonder if I should try to transfer somewhere else. Or if I should just muscle through it alone essentially, and get trickle down advice from faculty through my friends.",0.07128272521129668,4,False,1

Full disclosure: I don’t see STL as deep rivals. They have a great young team, and they are usually pretty good. Better than us historically. They also don’t have beef with us like they do with the Cubs, which I can respect, and I’ve rarely been hassled for real. It’s just fun to have some trash talking across the state.

2025-06-04 04:49:52,"22[M4F] Giant looking for someone special. How is it going folks? Good? That's good. Id like to formally put myself out there for anyone. As I've said in the title I am a giant. I am 6'9' and around 370lbs. But don't get scared by that number I am only chubby not fat. Plus being tall kinda evens things out a bit. I have mostly black hair with strands of other colors mixed in, same goes for my facial hair. I also wear glasses. (I know small details don't really matter just wanted to include it) I am a mixed black man from the US. You don't have to worry though I don't follow or believe anything the Cheeto in office has to say. My moral values and wants for my government are more socialist than anything. I am also an actor currently in the midst of rehearsals for a community play. (They have me playing a giant) I also work full time as a shift manager. So not need to worry about that stipulation on actors being unemployed. I play a lot of video games mostly multiplayer games. I watch a lot of anime. And listen to most types of music. 

Enough about me. 

I am looking for someone who has a lot of the same morals and values as I do. I don't mind if you live in another country I do plan on moving from the US at some point. And if you do live in the US that's one of things I hope you're okay with doing. I plan on having children at some point. Hopefully just two. Someone who is introverted as well but has no problem going out to do things. Gotta be able to talk about your day and anything you're interested in cause I like listening to people. But you also have to be able to deal with my ramblings as well. Preferably someone between 21-28. 

I know that attraction is one of the main factors for liking someone so I'm down to send photos or link my socials. (cause I really don't know how to send pictures on this app) I have my notifications on so don't worry about me taking forever to get back to you. I don't mind taking things slow and honestly I prefer it

2025-06-04 04:49:48,"Seeking $1500 loan - will repay $1760 within 8 weeks (wage dispute filed, just started new job). Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out in hopes of finding someone who might be willing to offer a short-term loan of $1500, with a guaranteed repayment of $1750 within 8 weeks. I completely understand this is a big ask, and I’m more than willing to provide any documentation needed to make you feel comfortable.

Here’s my current situation:
	•	I recently filed a wage claim with the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) against a previous employer who failed to pay me for several weeks of work. That claim is still being processed, but until it’s resolved, I haven’t been able to access the income I earned.
	•	As a result, I’ve fallen behind on some urgent financial obligations: rent, my phone bill, and the administrative fee required to secure a new apartment. My current lease ends on June 20, so I’m under a time crunch to avoid housing insecurity.
	•	The good news is I just started a new job today, and I’m excited to be getting back on my feet — but I won’t see my first paycheck for at least two weeks, and that paycheck won’t be enough on its own to cover all these immediate expenses.

I’m offering a total repayment of $1750 within 8 weeks (no later than early August). If my pending wages from the IDOL claim come through before then, I’d be able to pay you back sooner. I can provide:
	•	Proof of my new employment
	•	A copy of the wage dispute claim I filed
	•	Personal ID and references
	•	A written agreement, payment plan, or anything else you’d need to feel confident

I’m not asking for a handout — just some help bridging the gap between now and when I’m able to support myself fully again. Every dollar of this loan will go toward stabilizing my basic needs and making sure I don’t lose housing or communication access during this critical period.

I’m happy to talk through details and make sure everything is clear and transparent.

Thank you so much for reading — I truly appreciate your time.

2025-06-04 04:49:46,"I killed my cat. I moved to another city on the other side of the country to study when I was 18. When I was living alone, I adopted this beautiful orange girl kitty. I remember taking her in my arms the first time. She was described as very shy, but very adventurous by the woman taking care of her as a temporary home. She was terrified of everyone, but I immediately felt a connection when I took that tiny ass 3 month kitten into my arms and she grabbed my sweater with her tiny claws, shaking. She knew nothing about the world, but was brave enough to face the scary toys that were given to her and chase the balls. She was just playing by herself all this time before I got into her life.  
I took her home. She was my first cat. I had no prior experience and I learned the hard way how cats behave and communicate with us in the following years. The hiding part didnt last much long. I was able to mesmerize her with shiny toys and tasty treats, and she began to trust me little by little, to her mistake. She slowly started to get comfy near me, and we would do everything together. She followed me around with that fluffy ass tail that looked like a giant duster. She always had her tail up because she was so interest in everything, yet so afraid. She was the kindest form of life I have ever met. She never once bit, scratch, hiss or made weird cat noises to me or anyone. She enjoyed laps more than anything, and she would beg for me to take her in my lap. The only time we ever slept apart was when my grandmother died and I had to travel back to the country side. We spent 3 days apart and it hurt me so bad that I came back earlier to my studying city so we could be together.

We went through a lot in these times. I lived with different roommates that all adored her - but she was always my girl and no one else's. They told me she would cry a heartbreaking and haunting sound when I left to go to class, and then go to my room to sleep over my clothes and wait for me. I almost got married and my partner didnt like her very much because of how attatched we were and how unreasonable I became when it came to her. When I left for class and when I eventually graduated and got a job, I would schedule my routine around her. I hated leaving her alone. I tried another kitty but it didnt work out cause she was way too protective of me. I remember when this kitty tried to bite me and she attacked the poor kitten with a mighty anger that I have never seen coming out of her. She puffed her fluff a looked 3 times bigger, and just smacked that poor kitty into the ground. It was the only time ever I have seen her pissed off or agressive.

Pandemics came and I didnt leave the city in time, so I got stuck under lockdown in my studying city. My roommate at the time left the city, so I would be alone for the following year. Since I couldnt leave my apartment, we would spend all the day long together. She never left my side. Never for a second. She was always purring, looking for a way to snuggle and being a goofball. I taught her to do headbutts to my chin by asking for kisses. Her vets wouldnt believe when I told them that she would do this, and then they would melt over her headbutting my chin when I asked for kisses. She loved my beard. I would rub it against her fur and she made this face that she was about to transcend.

She was 7 years old when she started getting sick. I didnt notice. My friends that were at my place all the time would tell me she was getting thinner. I didnt believe them. I spent all the time with her. How could I not notice that she was losing weight? Absurd. She was always a tiny cat (around \~3 kg), and her weight felt normal to me. Then the weird behavior started. She would pee outside of her litter box and sometimes she would start meowing for no reason, as if something was bothering her. She stopped hanging out in my room and just stood in random places in the house. That annoyed me because I couldnt figure out why she was acting out. I thought she was being dramatic. I wasnt doing well myself either. I was finishing my phd and the pressure was harsher than ever. I started SSRIs because I didnt have what it takes and started becoming apathethic. I would no longer engage with my friends and my head would just focus in finishing my damn thesis. Life no longer had joy, and still she was by my side. We went through so much together. I really wanted her to be there with me when I finished my phd. She spent so many nights on my lap while I studied and analyzed data. She was the only living being that wouldnt judge me because I lost my way for getting a stupid degree. And I didnt notice the signs. I didnt notice her getting worse under my own nose. Or I did and didnt care. I cant tell. And that makes everything worse.

When she stopped eating, I would look for every single excuse to pass for a reason she was not eating. I looked at her gums and teeth, tried several different feeding pots and different treats/ rations. I would make excuses for everything and I wouldnt take her to the vet. Then one day I was bongoing her butt and I suddenly noticed that I could feel her bones in a weird way. It just clicked to me that something was wrong. Everyone tried to tell me she was losing weight. I didnt believe. I was too arrogant about knowing my own cat to give them the reason. I took her to the vet the same day. She was terrified on the uber drive. It was a cold winter night in the southern hemisphere. I got her in her transport box. She didnt make a sound. She didnt protest or made a scandal. She just went along. We took a silent ride, and then a vet on duty (it was around midnight) attended us. She asked me a bunch of questions, and each question increased my anxiety by a tenfold. I started realizing that I fucked up real bad. Like, no coming back bad. She is an amazing vet and treated me very well. Never once passed me judgement. She took a blood sample and asked to admit her under emergency care. Her blood tests came out fairly quickly, and it didnt look good. Her blood was acidic and she had extreme signs of kidney failure. I panicked so bad I had to ask a friend to come get me. She needed to be admitted asap, but she was never away from me for a long time. I asked to stay with her but the vets told me no. They have protocols, I know, but I didnt ask out of malice. I was just worried for her.

They took her to a room in the back and I had to go to the hospital myself because I was having a panic attack. I never noticed until this moment how I depended on her as much as she depended on me. She stayed in the vet equivalent of emergency care for around 2 weeks. I would visit her everyday because I couldnt stand being apart so long. The vets eventually started allowing me to stay with her more time. They told me her behavior changed completely when I was around. I was hopeful at first, but she didnt get any better during these two weeks. I would ask for daily reports on how she was doing. All the vets and the staff fell in love with her sweetness. They would tell me the cutest stories about her. Yet all I could see in the photos and videos was how terrified she was. I knew her little tells. She was in so much pain and fear, and I just left her there. But what could I do? Bills started racking up. They needed daily exams to check if the meds were working, and those were expensive for someone like me. I agreed blindly with all of them, and then I noticed I was over the equivalent of 10k usd in debt. I burned all my credit cards, all my reserves, and even got some loan money to help pay the vet bills. My friends helped me because they all adored her. Everyone came together. But she didnt get better. As time progressed, the vet reports would get eerier. I stopped sleeping and dreaded the morning because thats when the reports would come. Everyday I felt a fear I can't describe with words. Something so visceral that it stopped being logical. She got sick under my nose. She tried to tell me something was wrong. Several times. I didnt listen. I was too arrogant and apathethic to notice or care. She gradually lost weight and stopped eating, and I would always have an excuse for being a shitty person that I am. I was supposed to take care of her and I couldnt even do this. I was supposed to listen to her and I didnt. She was in pain and suffering because I couldnt get over myself.

The day I knew it was over was when the vet told me she couldnt regulate her body temperature by herself anymore - she needed a heating blanket. I cant remember the exact details of what happened that day, I just remember it felt like I was inside one of those snow globes, looking outside as everything was blurry. Someone took control of my body and my brain and autopiloted for me. I went to to the vet that day with a friend. I dont know how she got involved or got there, but I suspect I knew what was about to happen and didnt want to be alone for this. I talked to the vet and they showed me the most recent exams - all of the parameters had worsened. They ran a ultrasound (I think) to check her kidneys and showed me. I remember vividly the image. I graduated in biology and I could read the scans. Her kidneys looked like deflated baloons, with 2 giant stones inside each of them. It clicked for me. Thats why she was urinating outside her litter box. She was telling me something was wrong, in her own way. Felt like a flood of memories coming back to me that justified her weird behavior, like one of those eureka moments, except that every memory that came back made me more guilty and anxious because for the first time I realized how bad I fucked up. Like, no turning back bad. I was stunned looking at her damaged kidneys. I asked the vet what we could do, and she explained a bunch of stuff that I cant remember. But my girl looked miserable. She was so thin I was scared to pick her up so I wouldnt hurt her. She was always looking for water and urinating a liquid so clear that it didnt have a pee smell. She couldnt regulate her body temperature efficiently anymore. Part of her fur was shaved so they could hook up those IVs or some shit to her. She looked so cold all the time with the shivering. And still she was my girl - asking for pets, purring on my lap and giving me headbutts. Even after I failed her so inexcusably that I knew that there was no way to fix it anymore. I talked to the vet a bit more and we decided to euthanize her. I did, actually. Vet wanted me to try a little more - take her home, let her have a few more days. But I couldnt stand watching what she had become. A pityful skinny shadow of the loving kitten she once was. Financial was a problem too. Debt started racking up more than I could handle. I still am in debt to this day, but I dont care. I asked to be some time alone with her so I could say goodbye. The whole time she was alternating between looking for water and wanting pets. I told her how much I loved her, and told her silly stories of when she was a kitten. I grabbed my phone and watched videos of her playing with her toys. Then I took a selfie with her so I would never forget and double down why I accepted letting her die. The vet came back with the injections and we proceeded. First it was the calming agent - she started getting sleepy and drunk-ish after about a minute. I had to grab her so she wouldnt fall. I took her into my arms and hugged her as she fought the sleepiness. Then the vet administered the painkillers and she started falling asleep. All I could think was that night I held her for the first time. How scared she was. And how scared she must have been all this time by herself. She was a brave kitty. She fell asleep and the vet checked her with stethoscope. She told me, surprised, that my girl was purring. I dont know if she told me the truth or was just lying to make me feel better. It didnt matter. All I could feel was like my back didnt work anymore and in how much pain she was from the kidney stones to start purring from the painkillers at that moment. I talked her in a baby voice the whole time. The vet asked me permission to inject the heart stopping agent. I just agreed. She was laying in a blanket, asleep. Just like she would sleep on my lap. Her heart stopped and her pupils went giant. I couldnt even bring myself to cry. I just stood there talking to the dead corpse of my girl. I cant explain why, I just wanted her to know I was there. Probably out of selfishness. Who knows?  
Then the vet wrapped her in a blanket, told me she was very sorry for my loss and took her to a room in the back of the clinic. I remember staying there looking at the walls, too stunned to talk. The next thing I remember is my friend paying the bills for me, as she chose to not be inside the room during the euthanasia. I dont remember anything after that.

I cremated her in a pet specialized agency. They took her paw print in clay. Two weeks later her ashes arrived in a sack inside a manually carved box, and another box with her paw print and her name. I keep her remains with me all the time, as creepy as it sounds. I dont her to ever be alone again. I dont want to be apart from her again.

The thing is: I killed her. She tried to tell me she wasnt doing well in many ways. I didnt listen and I didnt care. The way I can described her sickness is that it looked like she 'dried' out of nowhere. It took me by surprise. How could something like this surprise me? She trusted me with her life. She loved me and we were inseparable, and I wasnt able to notice something so obvious. I am not religious, but at first I asked for forgiveness everyday for forsaking her. She would still be alived if I noticed. She would still be running around and healthy. Then I started tried punishing myself. I started self harming out of hatred for what I did to her. That didnt bring me any peace either. What could after what I did to her, honestly? Everyday I wish I had died instead of her. Everyday I loathe the forsaken day I took her in. She could have had a wonderful life with someone that took better care of her and listened to her. I killed my cat because I thought I was too good to fail as her tutor. She didnt deserve any of this. None of this pain and none of this suffering. She just wanted to snuggle and be silly. And I put her through hell because I couldnt accept what people were telling me. Every drip of love she brought to this world was cancelled by the poisonous shitty person I am for doing this to her. I wish heaven and hell are real, so I would know she is having a good afterlife without me to make she go through so much pain, and for hell to exist so I can rot in there and pay every single day of my life for what I did to her. I would take my own life to bring her back if that was possible, and that would be a no brainer for me. I wish I could see her one last time to tell her I am sorry for what I did. But I will never see her again, and that is my fault. I grew attached to that song by Oasis called 'Don't go away', specially to the part where they ask for more time to make it right. There is nothing I wouldnt pay to make things right with her. Its selfish to the core wanting more time to make things right and undo my shitty attitudes and decisions that led to this, but thats what I am: a selfish shitty person. She didnt deserve any of this. I do.

Its been a year this month since she died. I often catch myself looking through my cell photos to see her again because I am afraid I will forget her. I miss her tremendously. She was my best friend and my whole universe. Nothing else mattered, just her - and I failed. I did everything wrong, and I cant take any of it back. I'm sorry, my baby girl.",-0.0019942661352353075,4,False,1

I bought the Pad X C a couple of days ago. My intended use is to replace monitor & tablet when writing novels - to protect my eyes. 

I am not in need of colour, I bought it as it had the most advanced eink tech. However, I was quite surprised how severe the lag was (editing small or large files made no difference), and also how dark and ""fuzzy"" looking the text seems to be without the frontlight. 
My question to authors with experience in eink devices: which Boox model do you use for extensive text editing - writing books and such. I can still return it within twelve days. Sadly it is not possible to try them out as they are not available in my or in neighboring countries.

As for the lag I tried to play with the settings to optimize for speed (even enabling the auto ultrafast mode in external kbd settings), and also tried lightweight apps like Markor and Jotterpad, but the difference was negligible. Ultimately I could get used to the lag, but the dark display is a bit much to swallow. 

Would you have advice for me if it makes sense to switch models? Or are the differences miniscule and the X C is the way to go?

I did see videos showcasing the Air4 C's nearly instantsneous response, so perhaps this would be the model for me?

Yet the priority is a sharp text on a white background even withou additional lights

Thanks & Cheers,

While we can't get players such as Isak, Osimhnen, Haaland. we might as well get him for way less transfer fee and way less wages.

They’re calling it a plug-and-play DeFi experience, and it’s not just fluff. It *works*. If they follow through and add Arbitrum (which is on the roadmap), this could become the go-to infra layer for developers building cross-chain protocols.

Imagine a world where your users don’t even *know* which chain they’re on—and they don’t need to care. zkCross is building for that.

Feels like the kind of infrastructure play that could quietly end up supporting dozens of major protocols in the next cycle. Still early, still needs to be tested under real load—but this might be one to accumulate slowly if you believe in DeFi UX evolution.

In response to other systems being mentioned or people seeing anti-socialist/pro capitalist ideas I often see things that are along the lines that with capitalism at least you consent to it. “Consent is cool” is one that comes to mind.

This is by far the most surface-level and misleading take. Saying you “consent” to capitalism is like saying a tenant consents to rent increases because they don’t want to die on the street. Technically, you can say no to any given economic system but only if you’re willing to face poverty, starvation, or homelessness. That’s not consent. That’s coercion with extra steps.

You don’t “choose” to participate in capitalism, you’re born into it. Your labor, your shelter, your healthcare, everything is held hostage unless you sell your time and energy to someone who owns more than you. There’s nothing “cool” about that kind of consent.

That being said it’s the same with EVERY system It’s not like with anarchism, Communism, Liberalism or even Socialism you consent to it existing.

TLDR: you don’t consent to any economic system especially when the choice is participate or live in poverty. Saying Capitalism requires consent is a sign you are lacking critical thinking.",0.15556818181818183,4,False,1

Literally, you are accepting the entire goal post shifting by the right. They initially said Imane Khelif was a transgender woman, biologically born a man and deceptively inserted into women’s boxing to get Algeria a gold medal. Mind you, Algeria is also a country where being trans is a criminal offense that lands you in prison. But fuck me, am I right? Cause that shit didn’t seem relevant to them. Now you are accepting that a woman born with a vagina and develops naturally with boobs and everything is really a man. And I’m the brain rotted one?

Then we get the news that, actually, Imane Khelif was intersex that whole time. Well let me let you in on a fun fact. That is A, something totally different from what was initially claimed and B something that has been allowed in the Olympics for 89 years. Because plot twist, genetic variations is a thing and we have to draw the line somewhere and the woke scolds of 1936 I guess decided to erase gender by allowing karyotype XY women.  

So to recap, people saying Imane Khelif was a man after all and conservatives are right are allowing the goal post to be moved on them, retroactively deciding that rules around intersex status that have governed the games for almost a 100 years mean fuck all, and literally allowed conservatives to redefine man to mean someone biologically born with a vagina (who only did so just to fuck with libs).

I’m really looking to make friends who don’t mind talking somewhat often, and really getting to know each other :). I really want to make some strong bonds, and have people I could regularly game, voice chat, watch stuff, and just hang out with! Even someone to do cheesy matching discord profiles/icons with would be fun. It’d be so cute lol! I’d prefer if you were closer to my age so like 23+ preferred, max 30.

Just a little about me: I have a degree and am currently studying for a licensure! I play on PC, but I have an Xbox (don’t use it really). I use controller actually but wanna learn keyboard and mouse eventually >.<, not now tho lol! Currently, I’m really obsessed with Fortnite so that’s the game I really play almost everyday. I need myself a duo :P I’ve peaked Diamond in Fortnite Ranked :’D but I mainly play Unranked Zero Builds. I also really really love Marvel Rivals ALOT !! I’m a Loki/Invisible Woman main and would love a duo for comp and even just quick play. I peaked GM3 last season and currently I’m Platinum 1! Haven’t played it much because I hate solo queue lol </3. Bucky mains to the front please ;3 I have other games and can share my steam, but to name a few I have Overwatch, BG3 (haven’t played it much but I’d love to do a campaign with someone), Overcooked, etc! I also need to finish playing my Mass Effect run through so if anyone who’s played it before, I’d love to chat!  
I am very much open to trying other games! I’m on a budget right now though so only free games LOL! My PC isn’t very strong so I can’t run all games unfortunately (I’m on a 1080 GPU LOL will upgrade one of these days…). But, yeah I’m really hoping to find someone who considers me a duo ♡

Other interests of mine include Marvel, Transformers, Castlevania (which I’d love to watch the newer seasons with someone, I’m behind), anime, Star Wars (REALLY BEEN INTO IT AGAIN AND NEED TO CATCH UP ON SHOWS AND STUFF), and sooo many other medias! I also collect crystals, keychains, and more. I would love to do a Star Wars binge or find someone to watch the Clone Wars show with.

I also very much love love loveeee The Weeknd !! xotwod ♡ he’s my favorite artist/musician ever! If you’re xo, I love you already <3

I lean left and I’m lgbtq+ friendly! I’m queer ♡ I’m really big on someone having good morals!

If you message me, please introduce yourself, and list your interests or I won’t respond :P I can’t emphasize this enough. I expect energy to be matched! If your response is short I will probably not answer back. Prefer people who have things in common with me! :)

I prefer to chat here for a bit before sending my discord over! :] If that’s alright, then great.

[[Explore Top Rated golf cart bluetooth speaker on amazon.]](https://stronggarden.com/bluetooth-speaker/?kw=golf cart bluetooth speaker)
## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Golf Cart Speaker System

Before we dive⁢ into our top picks, let's break down the key features to consider when selecting the ideal golf cart speaker system:

*   **Sound Quality:** ⁤The most critically important factor! Look for speakers‌ with clear ⁢highs, balanced mids, and sufficient bass to deliver an enjoyable listening experience, even at higher volumes. Consider the‍ speaker's wattage and driver size, as these factors influence the overall sound output.

*   **Waterproof/Water Resistance:**⁢ Essential for withstanding rain,splashes,and accidental spills. ⁤Look for an IPX rating of at least IPX5 for reliable water resistance. IPX7 or higher offers even greater protection, allowing the speaker to be submerged in water for a‍ short period. A⁣ waterproof golf cart speaker is invaluable.

Do you prefer a handlebar mount, a‍ roof mount,⁣ or a clip-on ⁣design? ⁢Consider the available space and mounting ⁣locations on your golf cart to choose the most suitable option. Look at speaker mounts individually to⁣ ensure compatibility.

*   **Additional Features:** Some speakers ‍offer ‌extra features like built-in FM‍ radio, USB charging ports, microphone for ⁢hands-free calling, and even LED⁢ lighting. Consider which features are critically important to you and choose accordingly. Some even ‌include a golf cart radio⁢ that can be tuned to local stations.

2025-06-04 04:49:19,"Velkahelvetissä. Asun Helsingissä vuokra-asunnossa, jossa vuokra on 1030 €/kk. Ulosoton jälkeen minulle jää käteen noin 1300 €m vuokran ja laskujen jälkeen noin 250€. Ulosotossa on tällä hetkellä noin 55 000 € velkaa, pääosin vanhoista kulutusluotoista. Tilanne on lähtenyt käsistä vuosien varrella ja nyt pelottaa jo konkreettisesti menettää koti.

Minulla on tällä hetkellä vuokravelkaa kahdelta kuukaudelta (n. 2060 €), ja kahden viikon päästä pitäisi maksaa jo kolmas vuokra eli yhteensä yli 3 000 €. Lisäksi tulossa on sähkö- ja nettilaskuja. Tulot eivät yksinkertaisesti riitä kattamaan näitä.

Olen tässä tilanteessa pitkälti diagnosoimattoman ADHD:n /ja vakavan peliriippuvuuden vuoksi, joka johti holtittomaan rahankäyttöön ja velkakierteeseen.

Minulla on joitakin tavaroita, joita harkitsen myyväni, mutta ne ovat myös henkisesti todella tärkeitä minulle – niitä harvoja asioita, jotka tuovat lohtua ja tunteen, että elämässä on vielä jotain omaa jäljellä:

PC (n. 400 € arvo)
MacBook Air
MacBook Pro (tämä tärkein työväline, jota en mielelläni myisi)
Nikon kamera + Nikkor-objektiiveja
OLED-TV
Jos myisin osan näistä, voisin ehkä maksaa rästit ja päästä irti tästä jatkuvasta pelosta ja ahdistuksesta – mutta pelottaa, että kadun sitä myöhemmin, koska sitten ei ole mitään mahdollisuutta lähteä esim ulkomaille myymällä jotain tavaraa.

 Samalla tiedän, että asunto on tärkeä, eikä ulosotossa oikein pääse valitsemaan missä asuu.

Mitä te tekisitte tässä tilanteessa? Mitä kannattaisi myydä, ja missä järjestyksessä? Onko kokemuksia tavaroiden nopeasta, mutta reilusta myynnistä (esim. Tori)? Ja onko kellään kokemusta vuokranantajan kanssa maksusuunnitelman sopimisesta? Miten kauan häädössä oikeasti menee, jos maksaa osissa?

Kaipaan neuvoja ja perspektiiviä , jos joku jaksaa vastata. Olen todella kovilla ja haluan vain löytää tien ulos tästä velkahelvetistä, mahdollisimman vähillä menetyksillä.

Yksi vaihtoehto on että lähden ulkomaille velkaa karkuun ja olen siellä sen 15vuotta ja palaan noin 50vuotiaana, tällä tahdilla minulla menee 5vuotta 300e palkalla tai kolmas vaihtoehto on työttömäksi / työkyvyttömyyseläkkeelle.",0.0,4,False,1

I asked her about the surgery after putting in 2 years of research into it, as well as being apart of the discord, subreddits and facebook pages. I understand the risk and my end goal is surgery. I’m not on the fence about it whatsoever. This is not a magic surgery, but a tool and completely life changing. 

I’m trying to have a good attitude about this but her first alternative was weight loss medication. I’m willing to try it, but my intention is to STOP taking medication (with the exception of vitamins and supplements). I’m currently taking medication for hypertension and birth control for PCOS. 

The process to get the medication didn’t feel worth it. It’s been 2 months since my primary prescribed it and I still don’t have it. I’m waiting on the pharmacy to accept new prescriptions before I hear anything. To me, given the wait time on medication that I’m not even taking right now, had I just gotten a referral for a surgeon instead, I feel like I could’ve already had a consultation by now. I could be wrong about that but I’m starting to think going straight to a surgeon for consultation might’ve been smarter than going through my primary. She’s not opposed to surgery, she just strongly suggested weight loss medication. 

Recent diagnosis with my primary has been menstrual irregularities, PCOS, GERD, sleep apnea, hypertension. Surgery and weight loss doesn’t happen overnight, but the alternative hasn’t been beneficial for me. Should I be more aggressive (as in a stronger advocate) for the surgery? Should I request an appointment with a different doctor while she’s out of office and talk to them about surgery? Should I just take the plunge and make a consultation with a surgeon?

I’ve noticed that even with detailed plans (Notion, habit trackers, journals, etc.), it still ends up falling off our goals after a few days or weeks.

So here’s what I’m curious about:  
**Has anyone ever found a system (app, group, method, anything) that actually made you feel** ***truly*** **accountable and helped you follow through to the end?** **Do you think it’s even possible for something external to really keep you on track, or does it always come down to your own motivation?**

2. He never stood up to defend Krusty, knowing that she's a public figure. Both of them are disgusting cheaters but he let her take all the hate by herself. 

3. He caused trauma and confusion to 4 very young children, they saw how their parents split up. who will figure out in the future how did Uncle Preston turn into Daddy Preston. 

4. He's a misogynistic asshole that can't keep it in his pants and loves to bang other women in front of Kyra's forehead. He adores the idea of having a woman who looks and acts like he desires, that could explain why did Kyra change her style when they started living together and she got her boobs done. Let's not forget that he called his coworker hot. 

5. He is so rude and disrespectful to Kyra (she's a toxic and abusive dumbass too). He called her something like ""old bitch"" on her last birthday. He complained about buying a coffee to his pregnant wife on their honeymoon referring to it as ""bitch duties"". Precum barely touches her or kisses her, he always looks annoyed and disgusted around her. Based on the vlogs be barely moves a finger to help her out. Kyra is paying for his lavish lifestyle, trips around USA and the world, sexcapades, vacations, restaurants, etc while he barely can create an Instagram post for her.

6. He is dragging her to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Krusty looks so sick, stinky and dry lately, but he doesn't motivate her to be the best version of herself. Instead of promoting good habits like getting educated or eating healthy, he's dragging her to a life full of junk food, threesomes with strangers and alcohol. 

7. He was perfectly aware that another pregnancy would be life threatening to Kyra and the baby, but he did it anyways. Of course it's a mutual decision, but they refuse to use birth control and that can cause a whoopsie. He doesn't seem to give a shit about her health and wellbeing.  

8. He's an accountant and it's weird that he hasn't provided to Kyra any type of financial education. It's noticeable due to the way she spends money like water on nonsense crap. I'm under the impression that, when they get divorced, he's going to take away all he can and leave both Kyra and Oscars kids with nothing. 

I can go on and on but I think these are the most important reasons why he's a piece of shit, he doesn't deserved to be referred to as a man. ",-0.07904761904761902,4,False,1

On my way from Albuquerque, NM to Page, AZ I stopped at the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest. When I was still north of I40 I pulled over for the amazing view. 

As I was walking up to the overlook I saw what I thought was a raven. I don’t know a lot about birds, but I’ve leaned a little dark (never goth, but my predominantly black wardrobe drives my technicolor bestie insane) my entire life so as I walked up I said to him, “Hey man, how are you doing? Are you a raven? You’re pretty awesome regardless of whether you’re a raven or another type of bird.” I went on to make conversation with him for a few minutes, and then I told him it was time for me to continue on my journey but it was great meeting him. I walked the 150ft or so back to my car and hopped in, and as I went to close the door I saw he’d followed me. It was so sad to leave him.

2025-06-04 04:48:57,"How We Cheat The Car Buying System. Finding good deals on cars is something that every customer wants us to do for them as their personal car shopper.  The thing is that each customer defines “good deal” a bit differently.  A large subset of our customers want us to save their time and by doing all the legwork for them, they consider it a good deal.  A different subset of our customers are abjectly opposed to the back and forth, confrontational,  “runaround” so when we handle that for them, they consider it a good deal.  Another subset wants us to save them money and we are pretty darn good at doing that for our customers.               



But what if we do more than that to help you get a “good deal”?  What if we can sniff out problems in a car?  Or catch little things that a dealership says or does to make us not recommend buying a vehicle from them?  What if we read that Ford is having trouble with its supplier for power seat motors so the price for power seats is about to increase a bit as Ford shifts to a new supplier?  What if the automobile trade magazines are running more advertisements by companies wanting to help dealerships increase finance department profits which tells us profits from the sale of cars is dropping so they are trying to make up those profits in finance?  Little things for certain, but things that could matter to you without you knowing.   



What if we come across an article like this: [Maserati's Priced Lower Than Toyotas](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2025/05/30/maserati-gecale-hertz-used-sale-price/83944173007/)?  Finding deals like this is another way we can help our customers with a “good deal”.  Does this example benefit everyone?  Oh heck no.  In fact, I doubt that we have any customers who care about a used Maserati.  But our customers benefit because we are always looking for things like this.       



Back when we were running dealerships, we called doing all this “finding our edge” and I spent at least an hour a day studying the car business.  At least an hour a day finding our edge.  Did rental companies just place huge fleet orders, because when they place big fleet orders, they are going to start flooding the used car market with their current fleet which will lower used car values.  We were finding our edge so we could capture more business and generate more net profit.             



My partner and I still call it “finding our edge”, but now, we use this edge for good rather than evil”.  We use our edge to help our clients find not just what they believe is a good deal, but what we believe is an even better deal.  We don’t want you to just be happy with the car.  We want you to be happy with the car because you bought it that we can see operates fairly.  We want you to be happy with the car because we were able to save you an additional $700 because the car you are buying has a larger than normal day's supply of inventory.  We want you to enjoy your good deal because you didn’t have to spend 6 hours on a Saturday cramped in an office and hammered on by a car salesman, sales manager, and finance manager.  This is what you want from us.  We call our company “car concierge” and we tell people we are personal car shoppers, but we are not simply purchasing off a shopping list.  When you hire us, we are doing more than just looking for “black Tahoe with sunroof, tan leather interior and 4 wheel drive”.  You are spending way too much money for us to be treating it like a grocery list.                    

This post is titled “How We Cheat The Car Buying System” for a reason.  We cheat the system because we know as much or more about the car buying system as the dealership “professionals”.  Dealership personnel rely on uneducated customers, or impatient customers, or customers who are willing to “just get this over with.”  They spend all day trying to find customers so they can make more profit.  We spend our time finding ways to make sure our customers are getting a good deal.  And that’s our cheat.  We are working as hard as the dealerships, but our work is done to achieve the absolute opposite for you.  Dealerships want a good deal for them.  Texas Car Concierge is going to get a good deal for YOU.

So in case the Toyota Logiconomi demo wasn’t impressive enough — Auki Labs also got accepted into **NVIDIA Inception**, their elite startup support program for companies pushing the boundaries in AI and advanced computing.

That’s not just a badge — it unlocks access to NVIDIA’s top-tier hardware (yes, the good GPUs), AI/vision SDKs, deep learning resources, and a global dev ecosystem.

# 🚀 Why does this matter now?

Because what Auki is building — real-time shared spatial awareness (Cactus + the posemesh) — needs heavy compute to scale. Edge AI, multi-agent environments, low-latency localization, etc. You can’t fake that on a Raspberry Pi.

So this is strategic:

* Toyota brings real-world industrial deployment ✅
* NVIDIA brings the muscle to scale it technically ✅

One brings the **use case**, the other brings the **firepower**.

# 🧱 What’s next?

Auki hinted that this support will help push forward:

* Their Visual Positioning System
* Shelf Scanning Robots
* Real-time Reconstruction Servers
* The broader **posemesh** (aka: the world’s shared spatial memory layer)

If this works, it won’t just be Toyota using it. Any robot, drone, AR headset or smart camera could tap into a real-time shared map of the world — no QR codes, no lidar towers.

Not gonna lie, it’s rare to see this level of early momentum from a spatial tech company *without* being tied to Big Tech (Apple, Meta, etc.).

Independent, interoperable, and now powered by NVIDIA?

CoreWeave didn’t save Applied Digital — they chose them.

🧠 CoreWeave isn’t some crypto startup — it’s a next-gen hyperscaler
	•	Backed by NVIDIA, Blackstone, Magnetar, Coatue, and others.
	•	Raised $7B+ to scale AI compute — they’re building where the cloud giants are lagging.
	•	They’re powering Inflection, Mistral, Runway, and other top-tier AI firms.
	•	If CoreWeave is your customer, you’re doing something right — not barely staying alive.

⚡ The 250 MW deal is a massive validation of APLD’s model
	•	This is the biggest AI data center lease in APLD’s history — period.
	•	It locks in multi-year, recurring high-margin revenue.
	•	CoreWeave scouted, selected, and signed Applied Digital for their scale, speed, and cost-efficiency.
	•	APLD is executing. No hype — just signed contracts.

💥 APLD is not “saved” — it’s scaling
	•	Already delivering capacity across multiple campuses.
	•	Partnering with real customers, not pipe-dream SPACs or GPU Twitter fads.
	•	Repositioned from crypto hosting to AI and HPC infrastructure — successfully.

📉 To the trolls claiming “bankruptcy is coming” — where’s the logic now?
	•	No bankrupt company lands a 9-figure lease with one of the fastest-growing AI firms in the U.S.
	•	No bankrupt company builds hundreds of megawatts of compute capacity in less than 2 years.
	•	No bankrupt company gets institutional ownership north of 50% with State Street, BlackRock, Vanguard all increasing stakes.

Today I did the second day of the Forklift License which is the assessment test.
The teacher was so rude and unhelpful, talking to me like I’m insane if I get something wrong, every other course I’ve done like the white card/ rsa/ first aid, the teacher usually just gives you the answers. 
I did it at License 4 Work.
I got 8 questions wrong which I feel like is quite good having we only had a day to study but he was talking to me like I was an idiot. 
I feel like I have just been scammed out of $400 and another 150 because I had to reschedule due to a family issue. 
Now I have to pay another 100 for a re-assessment.
I feel like they are scamming people because even for a drivers license it is not that difficult. The theory test is multiple choice, these were written answers so we had to memorise all of this in a day which to me is more of a memory test than proving the ability to work a forklift. 
I don’t desperately need the license but I feel like I have just wasted $550.

Should I reschedule or just let it go and find somewhere else because idk I feel like for $400 they should be helping you pass first time. It’s quite ridiculous, working a forklift is not that hard.

I really wanted to like these as I was hoping other companies might go the route they've gone too to replicate snus as much as possible. To that end, they actually are just like using snus in many ways. However, the after taste is not good.  Could be I just need to use em more and I would get used to it, but not likely. It's just an odd mint flavor. Not candy like, but not like any other snus or pouch I've tried. Could just be me, but if you try these thinking it will be exactly like your favorite mint tobacco product, you might be disappointed. However, I love the concept. I've tried similar stuff here in the US that resembled a dip or snus product, like fully loaded pouches, but those things were God-awful, almost sickening. (At least for me, anyways...) The moose, though, it's as close to the real deal as I've tried. It's just that odd mint flavor with a hard to describe aftertaste that ruined it for me. I have not tried their other mint pouch, but I'm sure it's similar. So, The Moose is something I think could be a great experience for many, just not for me with that flavor. But the concept overall, I hope they make other variants. I hope GN starts making them like this, Siberia or Odens nic pouches would be phenomenal if they were made like The Moose Polar, with an Odens-cold white dry type flavor, that would be incredible. (If you liked the snus versions.) Same thing if Swedish Match makes something based on say, Rape', General, Nick and Johnny, etc., I'm sure people would love them if they got the flavors right. I still use snus, and nic pouches,but would love to see nicotine pouches that are similar in flavor, etc., as much as would be possible to some of my favorite tobacco brands. It is just my opinion, which means doodley squat in the grand scheme of things, but in my humble opinion, if they could get the flavors right, the pouches, if made like the Moose, could become the next big thing in the nicotine product world. And I am saying that despite not particularly liking the flavor of this Moose brand. Not there is anything wrong with Zyn, On, Velo Plus, etc., but I suspect ex snus or ex Copenhagen, Skoal, etc. users would gravitate towards a similar product like Moose Polar if nothing else, for the experience being somewhat like their former brands. There is also a Moose Gotland version, which I suspect might be the best tasting one at the moment as the aftertaste  I experienced with Polar might fit just right with a more tobacco flavored nic pouch. (Bergamot I think, actually). Anyways, the stuff is definitely worth a try, and I hope other companies create similar brands like the Moose nicotine pouches. Could be that it will never happen like I hope it might, but if nothing else, enjoy these Moose pouches for what are if you can find the flavor you like, while they are available. Its definitely not a typical nicotine pouch experience. All white Siberia is fine, but Siberia red nic pouches would be pretty nice, also, if GN decided to make something like that... Hopefully, the Moose is on to something here....",0.1401866151866152,4,False,1

I switch the country in my account settings, but whenever I go to purchase a book, it keeps trying to redirect me back to Canada. I add it to my cart, and try and purchase it and it just says the cart is empty. Is there a way around this? ",0.010000000000000004,4,False,1

I don't know if I should clip my long form video or make a brand new shorts video ABOUT my long form video.

I just made my first short (which was a clip taken from my long form content) and it's not doing well. 75% have swiped away :( :(

Do you guys film separate shorts or just clip from your longer form content?

Low-mid range, entry level 1080p gaming, rtx enabled, and it doesn't even have an hdmi? I'm still seeing posts from as recent as 10 months ago asking if it's worth buying. How can any card made after 2010 not have at least 1 hdmi port?! Is there any way I can enable 4k resolution (48"" 4k TV) on this thing, or do I need to drop another 100$ on a used gpu? My 2070s is way too powerful for what she needs it for. I would use the r7 1700x integrated graphics if it supported 4k, but I don't think it does.",-0.06249999999999997,4,False,1
