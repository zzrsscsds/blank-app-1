2025-05-22 01:00:00,"I can’t seem to stop asking questions and feel selfish. It’s been 2.5 weeks since DDay and I keep asking questions about the month long affair my spouse had and the foundation he had built before that/ flirting for months because you don’t just randomly meet a coworker and end up kissing them. He is sorry he hurt me and recognized what he did was wrong. But everytime I want to discuss when he was seeing someone else or something along the lines of why he couldn’t tell me immediately after the first kiss happened it reminds him of how rock bottom our marriage had hit. It reminds him of how he was unseen, neglected and treated badly by me. He said he at the time didn’t care about what repercussions his actions would have on our marriage and potentially wanted to be seen by someone. I feel terrible for asking him about why/ how / what happened every single day. I feel selfish for not being able to move past it. I feel like the bad guy for asking the questions and that I neglected him ….  TNT presents “Going Inside,” a tribute to Inside the NBA, quickly followed by a Beyoncé Levi Commercial..

You don't want us to fill empty shelf space? Good luck selling air.... Years ago, I worked for a medium-sized retailer which sold all sorts of things, from confectionery to garden supplies. 
The store had half an aisle near the front of the store dedicated to events, which were pretty much right in the customers' faces as they entered the store. 

Every few weeks, these event shelves would change over to a new department, or be themed to any upcoming holidays or special days, such as Mother's Day or Halloween.

Usually for these events, we would get the stock delivered the week before, and spend that week taking out the old stock and replacing it with the new lines. If a new line was missing from the delivery, we'd go and find a different line that would fit into that event from elsewhere in the store.

One day in early April, we received an email from upper management:

""Do not replace missing event lines with any other lines."" 

We emailed back to clarify, because of course, nearly every event delivery is missing at least one line. Do they want us to spread other items out to fill the empty space, or what?

""Just leave the space for any missing lines empty. It will look like they have sold out.""

Barely a month later, while preparing for the Mother's Day event, we receive our regular delivery, with no Mother's Day event lines - not one. So we email upper management to let them know that we haven't received any of the event lines.

""They will come on your next delivery. Do not fill empty space.""

Well, they did not arrive on the next delivery either. We emailed them again, informing them that we had still not received any event lines, and heard nothing back, so we decided to do exactly what they asked. We cleared out the old event lines, and left the entire event section completely empty, for the entire 3 week period leading up until Mother's Day.

After Mother's Day, during a conference call (a group call between upper management and all the store managers for the region), they asked us why we had zero sales for the event lines, and why our sales for the period had dropped significantly. We just referred them back to other previous emails where we told them that we never received the delivery, and they had said not to fill missing lines. Cue the most deliciously sweet awkward silence.

After the call, one more email was sent out to everyone:

""Please use your best judgement when filling missing lines for events."" Which classic works talk about greed?. I’m referring to fictional books like *The Iliad*, *The Odyssey*, Shakespeare, or *Don Quixote*—stories where greed is one of the central themes.

Every time veganism comes up online, if they’re not saying we’re preachy holier-than-thou jerks, they’re saying we feed them allergens without empathy and I just don’t get it.

How to approach my GM about the new campaign.. Starting a new campaign,  and it is supposed to be more RP heavy than our last. Last time I tried to leave my character's background open enough to work with the setting since I wasn't familiar with it (1e homebrew). I was basically a third wheel while nearly every other character got to have their backgrounds worked into the campaign at some point. I didn't mind, per se, since it was more combat focused, but after the first couple of years I was kinda checked out for the story parts since being a druid restoring order was all the character was, no bigger stakes. I like the group so I want to have a character who has a bigger reason to be invested besides 'do good things.' 

Unfortunately I am terrified of coming across as having main character syndrome. I really don't, I just want at least something from the character's history to tie into the campaign somewhere. I have plenty of ideas to tie my character in, but I don't want to give too much. I don't want to describe my character in case they post here, but I thought of fleshing out some backstory characters in order to provide possible plot hooks for them.

Recently was issued a speeding ticket for going 16 mph over on a highway. This level would be 2 points on my record according to the Ohio county website.

Sucede que desde octubre estoy en un proceso de diagnóstico de un tejido blando que me salió en mi seno. Después de un largo proceso en citas, exámenes y autorizaciones de la EPS por fin había logrado un diagnóstico y programación de cirugía para este mes (agendada desde hace dos meses).

Un día anterior a la cirugía  me llaman para informar que me cancelan la cirugía con la excusa  de que no tienen salas disponibles para el procedimiento y tras del hecho no me ofrecen como alternativa reubicar o reagendar la cirugía sino hasta una próxima fecha en la que ellos llaman para confirmar. 

Me gustaría preguntar si este acto, que a mi parecer es arbitrario, está avalado por la ley Colombiana o si por el contrario vulnera mi derecho de salud de una atención continua y oportuna y cómo podría proceder para agilizar o reclamar por mi procedimiento el cual ya estaba programado.

Si bien soy afiliada como contribuyente en Compensar EPS, la Clínica de Occidente es quien ha realizado todo el proceso desde el diagnóstico hasta la realización del procedimiento de la cirugía.

I am pretty new to geothermal. We moved into a house less than a year ago, and one of the selling points was the geothermal unit. It is an old house, built 1900, with generally poor insulation. The geothermal unit was installed in 2008.

We were having problems with cooling, called for inspection, which determined that the cooling coils in the unit had a leak. The refrigerant is all gone, and a leak is audible when  pressurized. The technition said that with a unit this old, finding the coil part would be at least $5000, if they can even find a part to fit this old unit. There also seems to be a problem with the hook-up to the water tank, as a back-up water heater.

A new unit is going to cost at least $17,000. I know there will be some amount of rebate. The tax credit is less appealing since we don't normally pay that much in taxes. 

Will we really be saving that much money in the long run? Especially since we'll likely need to get a loan to pay for it, including the interest.

Should we push for just repairing it and the various piece, whack-a-mole, or should is a new, more efficient unit worth it?  Reuben. Added provolone, mushrooms, red onion and light sauerkraut.  Help me mod my 1982 Opel Ascona Luxus C 1.6L. Hi guys,

I am not that familiar with modding when it comes to cars but I own the car that's in the title, and I want to start modifying it (not heavily).

It currently runs on 75hp, with a 4 gear transmission (will upgrade the trans to at least 5).

What are some recommendations? I was thinking of engine swapping to a C20LET 2.0L Turbocharged, though I can't find it anywhere yet.

I'm a Dutch student, so my budget isn't very high though I would love to hear some ideas and possibilities!

The car's in great condition, has basically no rust except for at the back window and front windshield underneath the window rubbers. I found someone who will fix this for me so then the car is in neat condition except for a few body marks that I will manage later on.

So I did a thing today. Not my pic but I just rode a 2024 INT 650 (same color, Black Pearl)  home to keep my Triumph Speed 400 company. 20 miles on the clock. It idles at 1100 rpm. It stalled once while slowing down. Any tips? Ticci Toby Question. SO
im like.. not new but also new to this all if you get what i mean, like when i was younger, i didnt have internet access, so it'd be friends retelling the stories to me, showing me fanart etc what got me into Creepypasta initially, and ive always been attatched to Toby, and ive watched Marble Hornets last year (FREAKING LOVE IT OMG)

from what ive gathered, his original story was taken down, but my main question is why people in memes and short videos etc put Toby in with Masky and Hoodie? was his original story almost like a fanfic or self insert to the story? ive half listened to a youtube video kinda like audio book thingy of a fanfic based on the original story, but gave up because it wasnt the original and didnt answer my question

the friends that got me into Creepypasta either dont like it/remember it anymore, or i dont talk to them anymore, and my current friends arent as into it as i am, like i cosplay Toby, and im working on a closet cosplay of Masky, i just feel so bad being in the dark on this 😭

 Just Talked to Support - I'm Going CRAZY. This HAS to be Illegal, RIGHT??. I recently got a new copy of Minecraft on PS5 for my youngest so she could play with my oldest on his Switch. Unfortunately, it didn't allow her to access Friends at all or play online. I FINALLY figured out how to get her account to login to her Microsoft account she had for the Switch version (it required me to have her MS account pass match MY Playstation pass, which is INSANE), and then FINALLY figured out how to have her friend him (I had to do it via the Xbox website after requesting permission from my parent account even though it shouldn't require that anymore because I removed that restriction by changing her age to an adult), and so now I can see that my oldest is online, but it says that multiplayer is disabled still. I've gone through every possibly parental control I can find via the Playstation settings and the Xbox Family app and everything is set to allow multiplayer. I've logged out of her Microsoft account and rebooted the game and the console and fully power cycled it. I even reinstalled Minecraft and wiped the internal and cloud saved settings. The last thing I was thinking was that she couldn't play online because her account doesn't have PS+, just mine, but I looked it up and I have the Console Sharing settings enabled, so she should be allowed to play online.

I just got off the phone with Playstation Support. They told me that they cannot change her date of birth to make her account an adult account (BULLSHIT NO WAY THATS POSSIBLE). They also told me they can't delete any of the child accounts I've created because in order to do so, they have to have a purchase history with a credit card (BULLSHIT). I told them they are my child accounts linked to MY credit card, so that should work, right?? Apparently not. They said the only way to have a purchase history is by adding funds through a gift card. I was like wait, hold up, that's not a credit card though. So you're telling me that there's NO way to delete a child account?? She was like yes sir it appears that way.

IM GOING FULLY INSANE. What is even happening?? How are other children playing Minecraft online on Playstation?? They can't give her online access because she's a child, they won't change her date of birth, and I can't delete the account and make a new one with her email??

If anyone has any suggestions other than me sending a detailed letter to the President of Playstation, I'm all ears. How to Get More Google Reviews (Without Begging or Bribing). Let’s face it — asking for Google reviews can feel like that awkward moment when you ask a friend to help you move. Necessary, but not exactly fun for either party.

But reviews matter. A *lot*.

If your business isn’t showing up in the Google “3-Pack” — that holy grail of top search spots — you’re likely losing business to someone who *is*. And what’s the secret ingredient to ranking there? **Reviews. Lots of them. Good ones.**

The good news? You don’t need to awkwardly email customers five times or beg them at checkout. You just need **a TAPRO tool** — and a touch of charm.

# Why Google Reviews Are Like Free Advertising (But Better)

When someone searches for a business like yours, Google doesn’t just show them any ol’ shop. It shows the most trusted — and trust, in Google’s eyes, means *stars*.

The more 5-star reviews you have, the more Google says, “Hey, these folks are legit.” That means more eyeballs, more clicks, and yes, **more sales**.

But the trick is...getting those reviews.

# The Problem With Traditional Review Requests

Asking for reviews the old-fashioned way is like handing someone a map and saying, “Figure it out.”

* They forget.
* They get distracted.
* They end up watching cat videos.

That’s where **TAPRO** comes in — we make leaving a review so easy, your customer could do it with one hand while holding a taco.

# Enter: TAPRO’s Review-Boosting Arsenal

We’ve created over 50 products designed to turn your customers into your hype squad. Here are the MVPs:

# 🟢 [NFC Google Review Cards]()

Hand these slick little cards to a customer and with one tap, BAM — they’re on your Google review page. No typing. No confusion. No excuses.

# 🟢 [Tap-to-Review Stands](https://taprocard.com/products/tap-google-review-stands-3-pack-by-tapro-all-phones-compatible-black)

Put one of these bad boys on your front desk, counter, or anywhere people linger. One tap and boom: “How was your experience today?”

(P.S. They work with both iPhone *and* Android. We don’t play favorites.)

# 🟢 [Digital Business Cards](https://taprocard.com/products/nfc-digital-business-card-with-qr-code)

TAPRO’s NFC business cards let you share *everything* — contact info, socials, your website, AND that sweet review link. Impress and convert in one tap.

# 🟢 [Review Keychains]()

Yes, a keychain. It’s tiny, it’s mighty, and it screams, “I run a modern business.” Customers can scan or tap and leave a review faster than they can unlock their car.

# 🟢 [NFC Signs & Tags]()

Perfect for windows, desks, or even the bathroom mirror (hey, people scroll there too). Just tap and review. Magic.

# Real Talk: Why This Works

TAPRO tools remove friction. And in the world of tech and attention spans, friction = lost opportunity.

Instead of your customer walking away with good intentions and forgetting, you get them while they’re still thinking, *“That was a great experience.”*

We don’t offer hacks. We offer **convenience** — and that’s what gets results.

# Tips for Review Superstardom

Want to maximize the review love? Here’s how:

1. **Don’t Be Weird About It** Just say, “If you enjoyed our service, a quick review really helps us out!” Pair that with a TAPRO card or stand, and boom — review secured.
2. **Make It Fun** Have a little sign that says: *“Like us? Tell Google. Hate us? Tell us.”*
3. **Respond to Every Review** Even the meh ones. Show people you care — and yes, Google likes that too.
4. **Showcase Reviews on Your Site** You’ve earned them — now let them shine.

The nerve block has worn off. I would say the pain got up to a 7, so I started with acetaminophen and am now following a rotating pain med schedule. 

Question: my leg is swelling and pushing against the brace to the point the velcro is popping to relieve the tightness of brace on its own. The brace is painfully digging into my leg along the back. Is it okay to slightly release the tightness of the brace? It is making my leg hurt so bad right where it is so tight and my toes are tingling from it.

Sorry for the redundancy if at all with this question, but I’ll get to the gist-

I currently have an EON GCHD MKII plugged into my GameCube (obviously it’s DOL-001), but I’m contemplating picking up a retrotink 4K for future retro consoles in addition to my GameCube. I plan on getting a gcomp switch down the road too, but this question pertains to what I have currently

I read component cables are the best cables to use for a stock GC, but since I have the MKII plugged in already, am I better off just plugging the MKII into the retrotink via HDMI? Or should I swap it out for something like a Carby or even a Retro Prism component cables and plug either of those into the retrotink?

I mention the gcomp switch because whatever setup I end with at this point may be subject to change so any future proof ideas would be greatly appreciated Would love to be a friendzoned cuck 🥺.

I have a dealer local to me who I can meet with this weekend. He previously offered me $1500 max for my whole collection, which I think is a bit undervalued. I calculated my silver weight value alone at almost 1400 and I have many other coins that are not silver. Pennies from the early 1800s (1837 coronet large cents) dozens of 1920s+ buffalo nickels, more modern coins etc. Guidance on this deal is greatly appreciated! Submitting Class Notes, Study Notes, or Meeting Notes. About half of the postings on r/graphology have been notes. They may be class notes, study notes, or meeting notes.

They do not make the best samples for analysis for 2 reasons.

Firstly, they are secondary scripts because the notes were produced only for the writer to read. They may not be as carefully written as handwriting (such as in a letter) for someone else to read. There may exist a degradation of form level. They may not reveal a person's outer and day-to-day personality.

Secondly, notes are also likely to be highly structured with headers and text, such as in the above image. An analyst cannot make observations on left/right margins or ascertain rhythm of spacing. In addition, many notebooks are produced with printed lines that blocks ability to examine line spacing.

Therefore, the moderators discourage the submitting of notes for analysis. We won't issue an outright ban, but we will evaluate each submission on a case by case basis.

No agents (buying or selling). Home inspection and loan related advice.. The buyer and seller both don’t have agents. The showing was done and the seller is agreeing for a home inspection. Both can sit either with a lawyer or a realtor with a flat fee and get the paperwork done but that’s not the worry. 

Buyer is curious on how to go about home inspections and finding a loan officer. 

Usually the officers are working with certain companies and push you to work with their team ( not too much sure about the whys but that seems to be the trend). Is it possible that a loan officer would tell me what loan they can get me and give me quotes? If I go to multiple officers would they all do a hard pull multiple times and bring my credit score down? I am above 720 ( nearing 800 something last time I checked last year).

I've tried restarting my game :( Guitar teacher or me ?. So im sorry if this is what is supposed to happen but I don't know so that's why I'm asking. So I went to my first lesson today. I sat down and waited, a good ten seconds ( doesn't seem long but in a room with someone you don't know feels like forever ) then I spoke up. He waited for me to ask questions.

My great grandpa's old guitar. It has paint on it (not me) and me and my friend couldn't find an exact replica. All I know is that it's an epiphone and that the serial number is 60016 Can anyone explain how Syncrony’s credit works for Mattress Firm?. I bought a guitar from Sweetwater some years ago using Synchrony credit. It was supposed to be 0% interest for 48 months. I never missed a payment but discovered three months in they were charging me 30% interest. I was still within the 48 month period and never missed a payment. But for all three months they were charging me full interest from the start. My grandfather pod the remaining balance on his credit card and I paid him to remainder. He saved me from taking all that interest I shouldn’t have been paying. 

Now Mattress Firm wants to finance me for a mattress through Synchrony. They say it’s 72 months 0% interest. I’m afraid of the same thing happening here. I understand deferred interest, I can definitely pay this off within 72 months. I can honestly have it paid off within 24 months. But I don’t want to run into the same problem. 

I washed my hands of the problem I encountered with Sweetwater and just figured they lied to me. I never got an answer for what happened and ended up letting it go. 

How do these credit lines actually work? How do you do this without getting screwed? My sales person is no help, he’s had the job for two days. He called his manager six times for help while we were trying to go over financing. If I pay this thing off within the 72 months, and I don’t miss a payment, I should get 0% interest, right? I only get the full 72 months of interest if I miss a payment or don’t pay it off within the 72 months. 

So how did I get screwed into paying interest with Sweetwater? I need a bed, but I don’t use credit very often. I watched my parents get screwed because they were kinda irresponsible with credit. They screwed themselves. So I never got into credit very much. But as a result I don’t know much about it.  Outjerked together by Sky Sports, Google News and Spurs.  HE COOKING????.  Newly Diagnosed.

I am a minor, studying at a catholic school. Ever since nag transfer ako dito sa catholic school na 'to, nanonormalize na ang bullying, pagnanakaw, at sexualizing. Lalo na ang mga ped0phile na mga teachers. Sa totoo lang gustong gusto ko na mag speak up about sa case na 'to, kaso nga lang wala ring magagawa ang Studeng Behavior Managemeng Office namin. 
Fastforward, pumunta na tayo sa topic na nalaman ko ang isang prof namin ay pedo. Mga bandang 2nd or 3rd quarter 'di na siya pumapasok. Nga pala, tawagin na lang natin siya na ""Teacher BK"", si teacher bk ay idescribe natin na. Mataba, may balbas at naka brace. mahilig siyang mag discuss tungkol sakaniyang mga personal experience, may one time na nagkwento rin siya tungkol sa kaniyang mga pet dogs na husky.

 
context:
nung una, approachable naman siya lalo na if may mga tanong and concerns kami, if di namin maintindihan ang lessons. Mahilig rin siya mag joke, pero patagal ng patagal. nagiging touchy na sya sa mga classmates ko, ang masaklap? nagpaiyak siya ng isang lalake naming classmate. observant talaga ako pagdating sa mga naka paligid sa akin, may instinct ako na mararamdaman ko if may alanganin o hindi. 


balik tayo kay ""teacher bk"", so ayun na nga. napansin ko na he's getting out of hand. Touchy na sya sa mga girls sa amin, habang sa boys naman minsan hindi nya pinapansin at minsan naman same goes by the girls pero may ibang vibe. fastforward, may isang araw na hindi na literal sya pumapasok, buti na lang may isang coor na nag subsitute sakanya. tawagin natin siyang ms ""Audrey"", mabait si ms audrey compered kay teacher bk, approachable at mahinhin. 


may isang nagtanong kay ms ""audrey"" kung bakit hindi na raw napasok si teacher bk, ang sabi? may sakit. nung una naman, naintindihan naming lahat. baka stress o nag uundergo ng therapy. pero patagal ng patagal, nahahalata ko na may something. 

WHY?? I was the first one to know in my class his image, kung paano siya magturo and SCANDAL. 

may grade 12 akong tropa na dating student ni teacher bk. He was worst and a big no no. Ped0phile siya, at malib0g. He even sends his n*de pics sa isang student niya. But evetually na take down rin .

Finally after a month, nalaman ko na hindi pala may sakit or nag uundergo ng therapy si teacher bk. He was kicked out of our school kasi nagdadate ng grade 10 student. 

Ayun lang and maraming salamat. ngayon naman ang problema ko this coming pasukan is kung paano iwasan nanaman ang isa pang ped0 na math teacher namin Mars & Arcturus Star. Celestron 60AZ Telescope. hi i have a question !. hi friends,

Best 3rd party (cheapish) wiper linkage for Cruze 2015?. Hi, 2 years ago I hacked away at my driver side wiper ball joint thing since it popped off and wouldnt go back on with some metal wire.. 2 years later and it popped off again. I went in to do my super DIY repair and found that the actual joint / turny thing that the arm pushes was ceased shut with rust and everything else. I took the whole thing off and spayed it and then decided to hit it with a hammer and bamb it shattered.

So anyway I want to get a replacement linkage (with the bottom part) and found loads of makes on [amazon.ca](http://amazon.ca), anyone know which ones are the best (and i mean cheap best). Bonus pic of my f\*\*\* up, thanks:

Hi guys,

I’m looking at buying my first diesel as my commute is 40+miles each way - basically all a12 dual carriage way. 

I’m currently doing it in a 1.4 petrol but it’s starting to really hurt doing £30 in petrol every 2 days. Plus the wear on the way.

What litre diesel should I be looking at? 1.6 sports? 1.8’s? 2.0’s?

Loona being bi is awesome, but IMO she should be kept single.. I feel really nervous to say this, as I am worried that people will be pissed at me, especially since this is coming from someone who is straight and a huge Loona fan. But please hear me out:

First of all, I just want to say that I really am happy that Loona is bi. It's nice to see that this show prioritizes queer rep.

However, I do have concerns about putting her in a canon relationship, and why in my opinion, she should be kept single.

Think about it this way:

1. Even if Loona is part of the LGBTQ community, it doesn't erase the fact that she still has a LARGE fanbase, especially within the furry fandom. When this character was first introduced, many people were obsessed with her in the furry fandom, particularly guys. It might not have been her original intention, but this is just what happens to most female furry characters in general (e.g. Lola Bunny from Space Jam).

Now I know that the furry fandom is predominantly LGBTQ as well, and that the gender of the fan is irrelevant to their love for characters like Loona. However, it doesn't change the fact that these kinds of crushes are still common within the fandom, and that if straight people can enjoy them, then so can queer fans. Therefore, if Loona already has a predominant fanbase, it makes sense to keep her single so that she can continue to be popular among both Hellaverse fans and the furry community, because both straight and queer fans crush on her all the same.

2. There's already enough relationships as is. People often forget this, but being queer and being in a relationship are not the same thing. In fact, some characters like Octavia or Mammon are ace themselves. Also, since relationships like Stolitz and Ozzie x Fizz are already well-done as queer rep (and given that there are also heterosexual relationships like Vortex x Bee, and Moxxie and Millie), it already makes sense to avoid forcing Loona into such a relationship, especially since she's just 22, and is already the daughter of Blitzo, a character who is already focused on his OWN relationship with Stolas, which has yet to be fully completed in the show.

3. Lastly, we already have bi women in sapphic relationships in this type of media. Not to say that we DON'T need more of them, but the way the Hellaverse in general does this is already perfect enough. In Hazbin Hotel, for example, the protagaonist Charlie Morningstar is bi, and she's in a relationship with Vaggie (who is lesbian). Not only is this important, but given that it avoids ANY stereotypes, and given that Charlie is less of a ""fanservice-y"" character compared to Loona, it makes sense here, and their romance is very well done. Also, if you didn't realize already, animated media has done this before. Think of Luz and Amity in Owl House for example, or Enid and Rose in OK KO! Let's Be Heroes! Oh, and if you were looking at the pride merch recently, you may have learned that Mayberry and Martha are lesbian and bisexual respectively. If that's not good sapphic rep involving a bisexual character in Helluva Boss, I don't know what is.

In conclusion, representation is important, yes. But not all characters need to be in relationships, and certainly not Loona. Even characters like Barbie Wire, Verosika, or even Sallie May, *they* aren't in relationships either, and they're still happily and openly queer! And considering the immense popularity of Loona, both in and out of the Hellaverse fandom, a relationship just wouldn't work for her character, and could still alienate fans on both sides. So while it's fun to speculate, canon still matters, and given that Loona is more of a side character than a main character (that would be Blitzo, of course), I'd say let her stay single. Sometimes, the best queer rep is one without a relationship. Yang. Yang passed away in December due to cancer. She was always the cuddliest out of all my rats.

If a men was getting attacked or r@ped would they protect the men?. See I always see those corny wannabe serial killer and edgy save Europe kids post on their honest reaction when a women gets attacked or r@ped or those save Europe kids complaining about women getting r@ped by an immigrant (sorry for my bad English). What I ask if will they do to the same to the men. They would also protect the men from those kind of things since I always see on comment section of women rapist on news that they also dreamed of getting r@ped by that rapist women too or that the man who got r@ped by the women is lucky. I literally hate when they protect women. And say men go to war. Got Nike socks under $0.56—seriously can’t believe how good they feel..  ITAP of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.

I am 19 yo and just started uni, it was a big change for me cuz I changed cities. I lost all of my friends doing so cuz they choose other university far away. Truth be told I am not entirely alone, I have a girlfriend which I love and really keep me company most of the times. But even with her, I feel alone, I have some ""friends"" from my university but I just feel like it's a one way relationship, I am always the one starting conversation and I feel like they don't really look for me if they don't need to. I have some family problems which makes it harder to come back to my city when my high school friends are there so there are days where I just sit alone in my room doing nothing but just passing time. I tried getting friends in here, got into a minecraft server and even that ended up bad, I thought I had made some friends there but in the end I feel like I always have to be the one sending the first message, I feel like I an being annoying and thay people just reply to shut me up. I am tired of being alone. I just wanted a group of friends or someone that could help me forget or digest some difficult emotions I go through.

Eu gosto da ideia de não estar em constante clima de eleição ao querer juntar todos os tipos de eleições (para presidente, prefeito, governador, vereador) num dia só, e acho justo aumentar em 1 ano (de 4 para 5 anos) o mandato, para compensar o impedimento da reeleição. Dizem que impedir a reeleição vai ajudar a ""renovar a política"", já que políticos novos sempre vencerão as eleições. Será essa realmente uma boa ideia?

Recently got an mri done of my knee due to increased pain from 3 previous surgies. First surgery was done in 06. Retore acl in 2017 and got it fixed again. 2nd surgery went bad and my graft got so infected the doctor said it was necrotic. They didn't find that out until 3 months after the 2nd surgery when my knee was bubbled up from fluid and had to preform another surgery. I opted to not go for a 3rd fix and decided no acl was the way to go. Fast forward to today and my results are as follows. 

The ACL graft appears intact but slightly lax.  The PCL is
moderately thinned.

Any idea on how my graft could possibly be intact after I was told that it was dead tissue and had to take it out? Going MDI on flights as an O5 user. Hi guys! Quick question. How do you go about using pens during travel?

Hello all! I figured this is the best place to ask this question. I’m from NJ and we are eloping on 10/10/25 near Snowshoe WV. We are not from the area but loved WV when we went last year. We are staying across from the snowshoe mountain resort. I originally wanted to elope at dolly sods or spruce mountain but it’s 1 hr 40 min from where we are staying. We are going to have family with us 7 adults 3 children so trying to find somewhere closer ideally less than an hour. Would love somewhere with good fall colors the mountains in the background and the sunset! We are planning to have photographer from 430-630! Any recommendations! Thank you so much in advance! How to stop eating / picking my nails? (kinda weird and gross). I think I'm in a weird, kinda specific situation. I want to stop eating my nails after literally my whole life of doing so (I'm 23 now).

When is ay ""eating"" I mean it. My goal is to take off a long, crescent shape and then I push it between my front teeth over and over. I do the same thing the plastic thing that attaches clothing tags to the clothes. I'll swallow my nail pieces, I spit out the plastic substitutes though I'm sure I'm still swallowing some accidentally. 

I need a replacement mouth stim and chewelry isn't the same because they're big and soft, but at the same time I know that it's not good to have small pieces of plastic in my mouth all the time. 

Does anyone have anything that I can do? I've tried putting anti biting polish on my nails, capsacin, vinegar, everything. I need a really 'out there' solution or something.  Making my own AI-Book Writer & Cloner. I'm building an app focused on the best possible text generation I can get. I built this after trying Sudowrite & other AI-writing tools that all came up short. I just wasn't happy with the output from these tools... either they didn't offer enough context size or they had very cluttered/cumbersome menus & options, etc... (and they don't have a upload your book to capture/re-use elements to let you easily create spin offs of your favorite books).

It's basically like you define Characters, Scenes, Plots, and World Elements (or upload a book to have those things extracted/generated), then drag and drop those to the book sections on the right.

To get the below, I just uploaded 1984, clicked to generated each section, then generated the entire book:

I'm using OpenAI API so it's a 1M context window with GPT-4.1 & 4.1-mini! It's early stages right now but it's writing pretty well using this method. It's easy to edit/create the Characters, Scenes, Plots, and World elements with AI as well:

The only thing this requires is your OpenAI API key in settings and you pay-by-use directly with the OpenAI API. Thinking a version of this could be open sourced so others could spin this up locally, and another version could be a paid web-app, etc

Thinking of adding an editor to the Complete Book so I can highlight/revise specific sentences, or extend an existing paragraph, Google model support (for 10M context window), Ollama model support, better Chapter formatting in the Complete Book, etc. **This is still under development so any feedback on what features you'd want to see & use yourself would be awesome**

So, I found out that a member of my dnd campaign(lets call them J) is dating my ex(C) and I don't really have a problem with it, me and C are still friends and she is in my campaign as well. But C is not very good with relationships.

She asked me out when we were just getting to know each other and we dated for two weeks. The reason we are not together is she didn't like that I wasn't Christian even tho she already knew before we dated.

When I got to know C better, I realized she does this a lot. She starts relationships for the thrill of dating, and then the high comes down and she breaks up with them.

J is a very sweet person. This is also their first relationship and I feel like I need to warn them about Cs nature so they don't hurt the way I did.

Thanks!  Worried about a new Apple. I planted this honeycrisp apple tree three weeks ago.  It's looked healthy, but I just noticed a lot of the smaller leaves yellowing and falling off. It was in a pot, but there frankly wasn't much of a root ball when I planted it. I fertilized at planting and have been watering when it's been dry, which hasn't been often (Eastern Massachusetts). 

Anything I can do to keep things from getting worse?

Bonus question, the tree kind of got topped (last pic) in the car ride home. What can I expect for for it will grow out? 📩 Business Development Manager – Water Treatment, F&B Industry Salary: 💰$105,600.00 - $147,840.00. 📍Remote job in 🇺🇸 United States.

Going to Gridlife Midwest and snagged a camping spot. The only other music festival I go to has early camping starting Tuesday and you can roll into camp as soon as the clock strikes midnight for whatever day you go.

I think I got HPV.... So, I moved to another country like 5 months ago and before coming here I didn't have any warts in my penis. 

After the first month being here, I had oral sex and masturbation with a guy but no anal sex (no anal sex at all so far), and I noticed two little bumps in my penis, however let me explain the location:

I have Pearly Penile Papules, since I was a kid. I struggled a lot because of that but anyways... These Papules are along the ""ring"" of my penis, however these new bumps are slightly below the ring and on top of the skin (but like the inner skin of the prepuce, tho I'm circumcised, it's just that idk how to call that part)

So, now after a few months I noticed the bumps (3 in total) got a bit bigger and now I can definitely see that the biggest one resembles the cauliflower shape that HPV warts have. 

Now, let's say I do have HPV (I know I should see a doc):

Is there any natural remedies for this? Like food or topical oils or something? The reason I ask is because I'm a foreigner here without insurance and I'm confident that it's gonna be a tad expensive to go get this treated here. 

Has anyone ever tried to cut them themselves and then just stop the bleeding? 

How long do these genital warts take to go away (without treatment) and is there anything we can do to speed up the process?

Hola soy Byron y quiero contar algo que sucedió en el 2014 soy de Guatemala más específicamente de la ciudad de Amatitlán.

Hace algún tiempo durante una noche di pijamada mis amigos y yo vivimos una experiencia bastante fea....

Era el mes de junio (aproximadamente) durante esa época acá en Guatemala es invierno pero en el municipio donde yo vivo apesar de que las lluvias en el país son muy abundantes acá en este lugar es todo lo contrario. Ese día nos reunimos como a eso de las 7 de la noche para pasar una noche de ""fiesta"" pero fue todo lo contrario estábamos en la terraza del segundo nivel de la casa de un amigo en este area solo esta circulada por una maya a eso de las 2 am vimos u escuchamos una lechuza dicen que estos animales son mala güero vimos como se paro en una casa que está cerca de dónde estabamos y se quedo ahi como a los 5 minutos un gato empezo a maullar mucho lo mas escalofriante fue que en una de esa parecio que hablo porque claro escuchamos que dijo la palabra ¡mamá! Fue horrible a los minutos de esos escuchamos un fuerte lamentablemente que parecía venir flotando en el aire en dirección de dónde nosotros estábamos, el lamentablemento era horrible, ponía la piel de gallina y provocaba un ambiente pesado fue tanto que apesar que no parecía haber señales de lluvia en ese momento empezó a caer una lluvia leve ⛈️ pero ni el ambiente ni la lluvisna eran normales.

La mujer paso frente a la casa de dónde nosotros estábamos pero nunca vimos a nadie, ni a nada solo pudimos escuchar y sentir como los pies se nos pusieron pesados como dos bloques de cemento.

 Radiator blowing cold air in summer. I live in an apartment that’s pretty old. The standing radiator goes off once every ten minutes in the summer — blowing COLD air. Any idea what could possibly be going on? I tried tightening the valve so there were no air gaps but it still goes off.  What If…the Port Mafia Fell?. As I wait for more of our fellow fans to chime in on this related post—where I ask for your headcanons about what Yokohama’s everyday people say or think about the Port Mafia—I’ve got a related scenario to run by you all! 

What if the Port Mafia, one-third of the Three-Party Framework, were to fall because of some conspiracy targeting them? 

For this scenario, assume that disbanding’s the “optimal” path going forward because there’s honestly nothing they can do at that point. 

What becomes of Yokohama? 

Do you feel the concerns about a power vacuum would prove to be true? Or would there be stuff that prevents them from tearing Japan’s second-largest city apart? 

I’m all ears for your scenarios and your thoughts—plus I don’t mind rambling, so let your imaginations cook! This company sucks. Rant/vent.

I finally left the Mac world and got a 4070 super, and now that I’m used to windows I realize how actual dog shit Apple is. Fuck this company. Fuck their products. Apple died with Steve Jobs.  JULY 23rd  IS THE LAST DAY FOR PLAYSTATION REWARDS ‼️🚨.  Un hechizo, simple pero efectivo.  26/CST - Variety Gamers Wanted. Hi. I am looking for someone(s) to play a larger variety of games with.

I have plenty of time to play, but I'd preferably like someone in North America so the timezones aren't wack. I'd also like to find someone who is open for discord calls, that's what makes multiplayer games fun.

Games on my mind at the moment:  
\- Minecraft  
\- MH Wilds  
\- DotA2/League  
\- Leathal Company > REPO (but i guess ill play repo....)  
\- And any other suggestions you may have.

 How to make a normal youtube channel into a made for kids channel?. Ive been slapping on the ""no not made for kids"" option my whole channel but I actually do want to make kids content.

Maybe shared templates that contain more information.. I have made the request a few times, but I am not sure the devs will be adding this feature as it's been a few years going requesting this.

I would like to expand the newsletter to showcase more than just new content. I would like to have statistics about the week. Things like:

• Movie/Series recommendation of the week  
• How many hours were shared during the week  
• Current # of movies and episodes  
• Most concurrent streams of the week

There doesn't seem to be any other serviced that provides this (other than wraperr which only seems to be Linux and Windows and my Plex Server is on a Mac). 

I know that custom templates are a thing and I would love to use one, but I don't believe the data I am looking to include can be added to the templates. I think that custom templates are just aesthetic changes.

Am I wrong? If I am, please help me find a solution. Or if the Tautulli devs can see this, can ya'll steer me in the right direction? Submittal manager here with questions. Hello all!

Thank you in advance! Please help me identify this mechanism. Hi all,

I'm a first year engineering student and am currently trying to write up my design for my first semester practical project, however I am having trouble finding the correct names for one of the mechanisms I designed. I've tried my best at googling using its description but can't really find something that fits.

  
The mechanism is part of a mechanical release system used to prevent it from extending until I turn a release knob on the back.  
It consists of horizontal bars with a curved quarter circle face that contacts each other when they are forced together, converting linear motion to rotary motion.

Below is the simple cad design and an in-progress shot of the build, with a red circle outlining where it is actually installed. (hard to see).

Rubber bands go over one end of the scissor mechanism and their compression extends it out to reach the required distance, however the design requirements needed a 'go' button of some variety, so I came up with this. When the knob is turned the bands contract and the bars rotate inwards and out of the way.

I've attached the video of it in operation if that helps to understand what is going on. I kinda suck at communicating these things, one of the reasons I am studying engineering!

Have gotten the radiator fans on and they seem to be working fine. Have confirmed the problem with the AIO is not a faulty socket on the MB by testing said fans.

For the AIO pump, there is multiple cables. There’s a three pin header that I believe is the power cable which you’re meant to plug into CPU or Pump Fan socket on your MB; both of which I have tried to no result. The other two cables coming from the AIO, pictured below, I cannot find a connection for beyond another (what i think) is a fan cable leading out the non-connected side of the radiator. Very confused, but feel like the answer is very obvious. 

Pretty confident the AIO pump isn’t working, as the fan does not appear to be spinning. What am I doing wrong? Chubby??. I would like to know from you men what you think about chubby women

Discrepancies ads manager vs events manager. Hi all

Due to bot traffic / spammy clicks with 0 secs session time, I decided to track my real visitors and conversions

I noticed there are some differences in reporting in ads manager vs events manager
I created 3 campaigns:
1. to track any button click (lead pixel)
2. to track any wa button click (contact pixel) 
3. To track form submission button click (complete registration pixel) 

There were some real clicks on each of 3 events for these past 3 days, and the numbers showed on events manager (15 leads, 5 contacts, 4 registered) 

But ads manager report only showed 4 leads, 1 contact, 1 registration)

Lived in our apartment 18 months and in the last week discovered mould on a bag and jacket in the bedroom cupboard- and now the side our leather couch thats against a sliding door.

It was obviously a very long and hot summer - how do we know if this is a full apartment mould issue vs isolated mould from bad ventilation? 

I’m quite concerned about the side effects from mould as I have ongoing undiagnosed chronic health symptoms…

Lived in Brisbane 8 years and never seen mould like this.

At least 16 years of age Should I (F30) consider staying in my current role and location for a boy or take the new job and relocate?. For context, I grew up in New Jersey until I was 20 years old. My family moved down to a Florida town, I wound up finishing college there, getting a job with a global company and have been with them ever since. I'm in an account manager role making over 6 figures.

When I was 28 I moved back to NJ to be with a boy that I had met through work but coincidentally he lived in the area I grew up in, which made it a no brainer to take a chance and move back up to NJ. I wound up getting a promotion within the same company which made it also very easy. As you could expect, he and I broke up. I still live in NJ and work for the same company. Just very much so burnt out from sales and feeling like I have golden handcuffs because of the money.

After 7 months of a terrible break up, I've settled into life still in NJ and was introduced to my friends cousin and we hit it off. I grew up with his cousin, know his family, and really enjoy spending time with him.

While at the same time, I've been recruited to come back down to Florida to take a job at the same company, no quota, and will get me a different experience/skills for my resume while still making 6 figures. This job is really similar to a rotational where they like to keep you in the role for 1.5-2.5 years and provide additional opportunities after that time.

I have this idea in my mind that I'm 30 and I very much so want a family and to settle down but also really enjoy having a stable job where I don't have to worry about money and am very fearful of the job market right now.

My options are:

\- Stay up in NJ, ride out my current role and eventually find a new organization to work for, likely still in sales. With this option I could really give this new relationship a chance. But I risk burn out and very potentially not having a great year in sales/lack of stability in a job. I have friends up in NJ that I grew up with and love the area a lot.

\- Move back down to Florida, get this new experience, potentially do long distance, and after the 1.5-2.5 years are up figure it out from there. I have family and friends down in Florida. I like the area for different reasons.

I generally want to raise a family up in NJ, however, I know the Florida position is short term and I don't think I would ever regret getting more time with my Sister, Mom, Niece and Nephew down in Florida.

I know this job offer is great, and I'm generally in a good position compared to my peers, however, I feel so torn between my options. It feels like just as I started seeing this man, I was presented this opportunity and now have to pick between the two.

Would you advise staying put in NJ and in my current job, or taking the risk on relocating and potentially missing out on a great relationship? (Sony ccd tr200) Recap on viewfinder boards results in left half of screen hard to see through.

How to go from dribbling with speed to close control. I see alot of the pros are amazing at this (of course there pros lol) but this is the main thing that I struggle with when I'm dribbling Vows are serious, but so is your happiness and sanity.. 
This sub helped me so much when I felt stuck and hopeless, so I wanted to share my story.

I’ve had two serious relationships before the one I’m in now. The first lasted about six years — I was the high-libido partner, and the sex was consistently terrible. It slowly chipped away at my confidence and sense of connection.

The second was shorter — about a year and a half total. We got engaged, had a baby, and got married fast. Looking back, I probably shouldn’t have married him, but it was complicated and a whole other story on its own. A lot of manipulation and coercion. You want to believe it’ll get better, that you can work through it. But when I realized I was in another sexually incompatible relationship, I knew I couldn’t do it again. I wasn’t about to waste another six years of my life. So I got out — fast.

The divorce took two years and cost way too much money, but it was still the best decision I’ve ever made.

People love to throw around wedding vows like they’re meant to keep you locked in no matter what. But vows are supposed to honor love and partnership — not force you to live a life that’s empty, disconnected, and miserable. There’s so much misunderstanding and judgment around that, especially from people who’ve never experienced sexual incompatibility firsthand.

Now I’m with someone I’m deeply compatible with — emotionally, sexually, all of it. I feel free, creative, and safe in ways I’ve never felt before. There’s something incredibly powerful about discovering parts of yourself that were shut down for years.

If you’re struggling, please know you’re not alone — and you’re not broken. Sometimes it really is just incompatibility, and no amount of hoping or trying will change that. But I promise, there is someone out there who will meet you where you are. Don’t settle. Just A Moment...I Have To Tell You Some GREAT News!.

I am waiting to board my first international flight in 10 years. ORD-LWR. I am nervous and anxious. But I am here. I am excited for my adventures overseas, and I am letting that excitement overpower my fear. 

I asked AI for a list of podcasts that are supposedly good to listen to during flights (if you are prone to anxiety). Thought I’d share: 

1. **Calm or Meditation Podcasts**:
   - **Calm (The Calm App Podcast)**: Features soothing bedtime stories, mindfulness exercises, or guided meditations to help you relax. The gentle narration can create a calming atmosphere, perfect for nervous flyers.
   - **The Mindful Minute**: Offers short, guided mindfulness practices that can help you focus on breathing and stay grounded during turbulence or takeoff.

2. **Comedy Podcasts**:
   - **My Favorite Murder**: A true-crime comedy podcast with hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. Their humorous banter can distract you from anxiety while keeping you engaged with intriguing stories.
   - **Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend**: Conan’s lighthearted interviews with celebrities are funny and conversational, making it easy to zone out and feel like you’re chatting with friends.

3. **Storytelling Podcasts**:
   - **This American Life**: Narrative-driven episodes with compelling human stories that pull you in, helping shift focus away from the flight. The storytelling is immersive and varied, keeping your mind occupied.
   - **The Moth**: Features real people sharing personal, heartfelt stories. The emotional and engaging narratives can be a great distraction during a flight.

4. **Educational or Fascinating Podcasts**:
   - **Radiolab**: Explores scientific and philosophical topics with a mix of storytelling and sound design. Its immersive style can captivate your attention, reducing focus on anxiety.
   - **Stuff You Should Know**: Hosts Josh and Chuck dive into random but fascinating topics, explained in a casual, engaging way. It’s perfect for keeping your mind busy without being overwhelming.

5. **Distraction with Humor and Pop Culture**:
   - **How Did This Get Made?**: A hilarious podcast where hosts dissect bad movies with wit and humor. It’s great for laughing and staying distracted during the flight.
   - **The Popcast with Knox and Jamie**: A fun, lighthearted dive into pop culture that’s easy to follow and keeps you entertained with relatable humor.

**Tips for Listening**:
- **Download in Advance**: Ensure episodes are downloaded before boarding, as in-flight Wi-Fi can be unreliable.
- **Noise-Canceling Headphones**: These can block out plane noises, which might trigger anxiety, and enhance the podcast experience.
- **Mix and Match**: Start with a calming meditation podcast during takeoff, then switch to a comedy or storytelling podcast to stay distracted during the flight.

Be sure to check out our live discussion thread for next week’s WWE Evolve! These Persons Are Attacking Us Because We Really Exposed The Artist. *By Staff Sergeant Chuckleberry McJokes*

**April 27, 2024** — In an unprecedented turn of events, our esteemed publication has found itself under attack by a mysterious group of individuals claiming that our recent exposé on the clandestine activities of renowned artist “Sir Paints-a-Lot” has put us in danger. But let’s be honest — we’re just doing our patriotic duty by exposing the truth behind the paint-slinging, graffiti-tagging, and interpretive dance routines that have taken the art world by storm.

**The Revelation That Got Them Riled Up**

Last week, our investigative team uncovered that Sir Paints-a-Lot, whose real name is reportedly “Bob the Brush,” has been secretly funded by a shadowy consortium of art supply companies seeking to monopolize the abstract expressionism market. Using clandestine meetings in art supply closets and covert spray-painting sessions on unauthorized walls, Sir Paints-a-Lot has allegedly been orchestrating a nationwide graffiti campaign designed to flood the streets with overpriced, low-quality canvases and spray cans.

Our sources confirmed that Sir Paints-a-Lot’s “art” is merely a front to push product sales and influence cultural trends, all while hiding behind the noble veneer of “creative expression.” Our exposé laid bare these nefarious schemes, and naturally, the art community and corporate interests didn’t take kindly to the truth.

**Who’s Attacking Us?**

Within hours of publishing, our social media accounts were flooded with threats, hate mail, and a suspiciously coordinated barrage of emoji-laden comments. The culprits? A loosely organized coalition calling themselves “The Creative Conspiracy,” which we suspect is comprised of rival artists, disgruntled gallery owners, and corporate shills—basically anyone who doesn’t want their cash cow exposed.

They’ve launched a disinformation campaign claiming that our reporting is “fake news,” “slander,” and “an attack on artistic freedom.” Some have even accused us of being agents of the government, which is a new level of paranoia even for us.

**Why Are They Attacking Us?**

Simple. Because we dared to reveal that Sir Paints-a-Lot is just another cog in the machine that’s manipulating the art scene for profit. By exposing his ties to corporate interests and revealing his actual identity, we’ve challenged the status quo. It’s akin to revealing that the emperor has no clothes—or in this case, that the “artistic genius” is really just a guy with a spray can and a penchant for fame.

**Our Response**

We here at [albertaswell.substack.com](http://albertaswell.substack.com) believe in transparency, truth, and the right to free artistic expression—particularly when it involves uncovering shady dealings that threaten the integrity of our cultural institutions. We will not be silenced by threats or coordinated smear campaigns. Our team is fortified with coffee, sarcasm, and an unshakable commitment to journalistic integrity.

**The Bottom Line**

If you see anyone claiming that exposing Sir Paints-a-Lot is somehow “attacking” artists, remind them that real art thrives on honesty. We’re just the messengers, folks. The real attack is on truth itself, and we won’t let up until the entire palette of deception is exposed.

**Stay tuned for more updates—and maybe some new graffiti art on the office walls, courtesy of our own creative team.**

*In truth and satire, we paint the full picture.* One of my rigs that we got to pull out.  IM A WRECKK. Just finished episode 9. Lord.. I loved Lawrence. Sure he had his faults, but he tried to do right and in the end he did. What a sacrifice. And now he gets to be with Eleanor once more. Such a noble act, but man that hurt. I didn’t want him to die. When he put his hand on his heart, I fuckin lost it. RIP Commander Lawrence. So fine, too 😭 Big Boom. Anyone heard a big BOOM around 6:20 PM today (May 21,2025)? Near Reid Hill view Airport?  W strat ? Or need to get rid the photograph joker?.  My Marriage was a mistake. Not asking for advice. Just need to vent. 

I’ve been with my husband for 14 years. We have a toddler and another on the way. 

And I’m so mad at myself. I’m mad because I feel like I picked the wrong partner. I look at other husbands and they do so much for their wives and are so nice. And mine is just mean, grumpy, and it just seems like he just cares about himself. Sometimes I even think he’s a narcissist. 

I can’t leave him because I have the baby due in a couple months and another child to take care of. I work full time but I still need the money my husband brings home to make a living for my kids. Yes I’ve talked to him, begged, pleaded and he says he will do better and he just doesn’t. 

I feel so stuck. I’m so sad and feel so lonely all the time. I want to know what it feels like to be truly loved. Why did I make the choice to marry him and have kids? What am I going to do. 

Does anyone ever feel the same? I Kindah Forgot What Are Wakatsuki Takeshi Reasons And Motives To Get Stronger And Keep Fighting In Matches?. Is it the thrill?Pride? Trying to prove his worth? Responsibility?

I Kindah forgot what's his personal reason to keep on fighting and trying to be the best, stupid yes cuz I forgot why do I need to be reminded I was curious and was lazy to trying to find the chapters from Ashura to find it.

Another reason is because in the latest chapter he did say ""itching to punch a human"" that's something Raian and Ohma would say but I guess even he with his humble nature has that thrill for a fight in him as well.

Is it obvious why he still wants to fight maybe but I still need a actual explanation why from experts of the series  Cat's bleeding scratches. He's acting normal otherwise from what I can tell, it seems like he's scratching himself and tearing skin.

It's going to be a 2 hour drive with high heat, though we will likely be using a cooler. 

I was thinking flower cupcakes or assorted bars maybe? I have plenty time I just thought I'd start thinking about it.  AIO: IS MY BF CHEATING ON ME?. I have been with my significant other for 10 to 12 years. Since that time we have obviously had our ups and downs like any relationship. About five years ago he started a new job. I am seeing a lot of things coming to light with regarding to female he used to talk to at his job. I started a new job two years ago, which at this time is in a hospital. Since that time, my boyfriend has gone through my phone search high and low for anything that might resemble me cheating. I am not in fact, cheating nor have I cheated with any people at my job. My boyfriend constantly brings up that I am doing things that I am not doing one on his side of things has random girls messaging him in his phone which when I do call him out on this, turns it back on me and a flex and fuses to take any accountability for his actions or that actions of the females that are messaging him. He will constantly make an excuse(s) for these individuals who are messaging him. It’s always what I’m doing (which is NOTHING) but he never lets up and is constantly in my face about it. I do not have a lock on my phone or any social media. I’ve caught him in numerous lies but somehow he turns its back on me. Anyone have any thoughts on this??

Thank you so much for your help Dante's Shining Light of Good Memories (@mrsheep673).  Black Cat and Mary Jane Watson [New Mangaverse #1 (2006)].  🙏🙏. plzz New watch questions!. Just got the E3 with the latest OS. Went through every setup menu and have a few questions:

- I could have sworn when I was going through setup in Garmin Connect or Connect IQ I saw something that said “apps removed” and it had a list. I found that super weird considering I just got this watch. I searched everywhere to find it again but couldn’t. Any ideas?

- Glances vs Controls vs Apps. What’s the difference? And it seems there’s overlap?

- Any glances or controls or apps y’all tend to add right from the get-go? Surprised for example that altimeter wasn’t a default but then I also see that’s part of ABC. Where can you see for example VO2 max or do you need to have an app or glance for that?

- What’s the difference between morning report and health & wellness daily summary? I see morning report is enabled by default but daily summary isn’t. 

- is there a way to tell if the watch is using solar *right now* or is it only historical?

- When running, but then walking for a 20-30 min cool down, do you recommend using two different activities or just keeping running going throughout the walking?

- the E3 is lighter and the nylon strap is comfy but it felt scratchy on my first use. Does it take some time getting used to or am I going to end up needing to switch back to the silicon from my F6X Sapphire?

Thank you!

I don't know how to mod my car?. Please help me mod my Opel Ascona C Luxus 1.6L (1982)

I am not that familiar with modding when it comes to cars but I own the car that's in the title, and I want to start modifying it (not heavily).

It currently runs on 75hp, with a 4 gear transmission (will upgrade the trans to at least 5).

What are some recommendations? I was thinking of engine swapping to a C20LET 2.0L Turbocharged, though I can't find it anywhere yet.

I'm a Dutch student, so my budget isn't very high though I would love to hear some ideas and possibilities!

The car's in great condition, has basically no rust except for at the back window and front windshield underneath the window rubbers. I found someone who will fix this for me so then the car is in neat condition except for a few body marks that I will manage later on.

 Summer Productivity. Summer break has finally arrived.

My first year teaching, I completely wasted my summer break. Laid around watching TV, playing video games, and generally being a lazy bum while telling myself it was fine to be enjoying the first extended break I had had in over a decade by doing nothing. I realized too late that I had wasted an opportunity to do so many more valuable things with my time.

The last two summers was better. Joined a gym to attend workout classes Monday through Friday (to force myself to get up and out of the house), made lots of pottery, followed a daily and weekly to do list that I mostly stuck to, worked a part time bartending job on the weekends. But I still didn't feel like I was being as productive as I could be with the valuable and ever fleeting 10 weeks that is the summer break. 

What do you all do to make your summer break feel worthwhile? How do you keep yourself accountable to goals you set? How do you even set those goals? 

Basically, how do you use your break to the fullest so you don't feel like you wasted it when it finally comes to an end?  I can help you with anything — name your price (marketing, editing, etc).

 100 octane fuel straight from the pump thats NOT e85?. anybody know where i can buy higher octane fuel thats not e85? i dont want to special order a barrel of VP since i have nowhere to keep it and its kinda dangerous to just leave at my place. also kinda done with pouring the right amount of octane booster in my tank lol. i know the 76 by target in redlands used to have it but not sure if they still do since its been a while, but any locations is greatly appreciated  Chirping noise during cold start. 07 GX470. 117k. Wondering what that chirping noise is coming from. It happens only during cold start and goes away after truck has been running for about a minute. Seems like its coming from drive belt but im not mechanic. Belt seems to be in tact no obvious tears and seems to have good tension. Owned the truck about a month now and service history shows belt was replaced at 88k in 2013. I can’t get anywhere with recruiters (trying to DCO). I’m looking to start a career in the military and defense sector, as a military scientist. I want to direct commission into 71 bravo (research biologist) position. I have a PhD and am qualified, I’m am 36yo and am fit etc. None of the recruiters I’ve spoken to have any clue what to do with me. I’ve tried to get my application to higher ranked officers and they don’t return my call and also don’t know what I’m talking about. None of the people in recruiting seem to be aware that there are positions for people like me. I got into contact with a LTC who told me this would happen and he asked me to relay some recruiter zip codes to him while he tried to organize things on his end. I also tried reaching out to captains and higher at recruiter stations (but again, they don’t return call and or say they don’t know what I’m talking about). I haven’t heard back from the LTC in over a month and sent a follow up email 2 weeks ago. 

Also got turned down from the Navy for a similar position, because my degree didn’t exactly match up with the title (even though it says “or other related field” which I definitely am). 

I’m gonna try to go in person one more time and set up an appointment with a captain, to see if he can connect with my LTC contact, but I’m not hopeful.

My upgrade set is nearly a year old and hadn't been cleaned at all since I recieved it last June 😬. I'm very careful with it, take it off to wash hands, clean or do dishes, or apply lotion, and I don't sleep with it. Took it to the local jeweler to be inspected and they cleaned it for me.

 Unusual Options Activity. Last Friday some of us noticed a trader bought 10,000 5/23 8.5P contracts for $300K.  Today it looks like that trader rolled their position into 8,000 6/6 8P contracts, for a $170K profit on the initial trade - while adding premium betting on continued downside (assuming these were ‘Buy to Open’).  $7.31 at expiration should be the breakeven price.

[Startup] Building an AI agent that finds B2B companies now adding a feature that pays affiliates for adding businesses. Hey everyone!

I’m currently building a tool called 2kai Agent, an AI-powered platform that helps people find B2B companies to reach out to ideal for lead generation, outreach campaigns, or sales research.

But I’m now working on a new feature I think some of you might find interesting: 👉 Affiliates can get paid for adding businesses to the platform.

**Here’s how it works:**

• Affiliates manually submit B2B company info (like name, website, contact email, etc.).

• Every time someone finds and unlocks a company you added, you get paid.

• Think of it like crowd-sourced data enrichment, but with real incentives.

I’ve already got payouts set up using Stripe Connect, and I’m currently figuring out the best way to manage submission quality and avoid spam.

The idea is to create a win-win: People looking for leads get fresh data, and contributors get rewarded for helping build the dataset.

**Would love to hear your thoughts:**

• Would you find this kind of affiliate model motivating?

• What would make you want to contribute companies?

• Any red flags or features you’d want to see added? Simple ignition instructions. Input all images here and follow the instructions. Ignore the “four”, that is just a minimum threshold. Put them in a few at a time. Any recommendations to fix scratches?. My car has a few minor scratches and some that just passed the paint and peirced the metal.

Medium straw with a touch of viscosity. 

Tropical fruit, juicy lemon, and flinty minerality, lifted by a grassy, floral bouquet. Could mistake for Sauvignon Blanc in this style

On the palate, passionfruit, grapefruit, and herbaceous notes layered over white peach. 

Vibrant with a weighted body, dry profile, and a green-tinged, slightly saline finish.

Medium length and a warm echo on the palate.

Paired it with Kingfish sashimi, tataki and crudo, but went best with black pepper tataki.

2024 Gisborne : A warmer-than-average summer and dry late season across much of New Zealand allowed for full ripeness while retaining regional vibrancy.

Vineyard : Coastal maritime influence; grapes from Doug Bell's vineyard, the first Albariño grower in all of Australasia, oldest vines too I believe.

In one of my answers, I believe I had the correct setup (at least I hope), but I used one degree higher for the exponent when writing the answer in scientific notation.

Other parts used this answer as well, but I think I needed the correct answer to solve those parts correctly.   I miss my brother. My brother is alive. We aren’t estranged exactly, but he is not the same kind and gentle soul I remember growing up with.
My brother was misdiagnosed with simple depression for years when in reality, he’s bipolar… 
He got hooked on meth a few years ago. Forced me to have him involuntarily committed and he went to rehab (which is where he was diagnosed).
Our Mom passed away a few short months after he came back home. She was his enabler. They were codependent and I suspect, she was also misdiagnosed her entire adult life, but that’s another story.
My brother is about to be homeless. 
I cannot let the man that he is come live with me - an unmedicated, unemployed bipolar drug addict. He’s unpredictable and volatile. You never know who you’ll get each day. 
I told my Dad not so long ago that I now understand how people end up homeless and low/no contact with their families because the lies, the manipulations, the refusals to take meds, and so on is absolutely exhausting. And then, you reach a breaking point.
Something is broken inside of me, because I can’t care anymore. I can’t fix it for him and he doesn’t seem to want to fix it himself.

 Does my wisdom tooth extraction site look infected?. Hi Dentists! Can someone tell me what I syringed out my wisdom tooth extraction hole/is this dry socket(pic attached)

35 F, non smoker, 3-5 drinks per week. 

I'm hoping someone can give me an answer. I had my left bottom, impacted wisdom tooth extracted last Monday (May 12). Plus a bone graft on the tooth next to it. There was a slight infection on the day it was removed. 

I was prescribed clindamycin following the removal and I finished the course yesterday. 

I was healing fine (!!) but starting Saturday night (May 17), I started feeling extreme pain! It starts in the evening time. The pain is centered in the extraction site, but radiates down my jaw and up to my ear and temple. It's so bad it brings me to tears. It can be mitigated through ibropofen and oxycodone thankfully. Pain basically non existent morning-early afternoon.

I also smelled something funkyyyyy (smell increased when syringing so I know it was coming from the hole) and had a horrible taste in my mouth since Saturday or so. 

Today: I attached a picture of something I flushed with the syringe out of my extraction site. It was gelatinous, congealed blood and partially milky white. It smelled like death and is DEF at least partially the cause of the smell and taste. Since flushing this out, the taste and smell have significantly decreased.

My question is, does this align with dry socket? Even if the pain starts in the evening and is mostly mitigated with pain pills? The pain is nearly unbearable at its pic. 

Does this pic look like infection? Or just buildup of bacteria, gunk etc over the week?

Thank you!!

Hello, looking for the specific knife above, if you’re looking to offload let me know, thanks.  Talk about twink death.  What names are you sad that you'll never get to use?. So I was just looking back on when I was pregnant with my kids and I remembered how for my first 2 pregnancies where I had twin girls in the first and a girl in the second and I really wanted to use the name Giovanna for a girl, but the first pregnancy my husband and I decided on the name Mary for one and he didn't think twins named Mary and Giovanna went good together so we didn't choose that name and Instead went with Hannah. But then for our 3rd girl I wanted Giovanna again but he wanted the name Poppy more so eventually I gave in and we named her Poppy. And I love my daughters names but I'm sad that I'll never get to use the name Giovanna because I love it.

And then for my pregnancy with our 4th that's a boy I really wanted to use either Marshall or Gideon but my husband didn't like those names and instead wanted a different name so I agreed to use the name my husband wanted and we named him Roger but we call him Rocky. And while I love his name I'm sad I'll never get to use Marshall or Gideon because I love those names.

But what names are you sad you'll never get to use? What's the move here gang. I feel like this is pivotal moment in the run and don't want to screw up  39f.  We're supposed to speak our minds here, right? Well, I'm shallow despite knowing I'm in no position to be shallow. I'm not looking to debate.

I'm a short ugly guy who likes pretty women. If I could conjure up my dream/ideal GF, she's short, well-shaped, petite, has long hair and soft feminine features. I can't pretend otherwise; I'm done feeling guilty. Personality can (indeed has) swayed me powerfully, but it's always the pretty women that will catch my eye. If I had a pretty GF, I would find any reason to forgive her. I would justify any personality flaw. The halo effect would work in full force. Of course, these women have no reason to consider me, fair enough. At least this way I can forgive myself when I pluck up the courage to go over the edge (""It's ok, there's nothing you could've possibly done to prevent being single for life. You had a type - which you shouldn't change for anyone - and that type's preferences weren't in your control"".) Why must just community be so toxic.

It is worst in the mornings (and may be agitated by sleeping with my hands curled up under my chin). There’s actually two, but one is significant, maybe the size of a large grape if you cut it in half and stuck it on the back of your hand. It’s is on the dorsal, ulnar/medial side. Hand/wrist doctor ruled out cyst and sent me for lab work. Everything came back normal. Primary care sent me to a physical therapist, who also had no idea what it could be. 

This lump can cause a dull/throbbing ongoing pain when it is badly swollen, and will limit my range of motion. Recently dropped something and reacted to grab it and was in tears from how much pain it had caused. If I ball my hand into a fist, it is spread a little flatter side to side across the back of my hand. If I flex my fingers, it concentrates proximally and becomes less spread out and more confined/taller. The second bump is proximal to this one. My right hand has the same bumps but significantly smaller and do not cause really any pain. If I rub a finger down the back of my hand over the bump (especially the second bump that is smaller), it creates a ton of pain and I can feel it on the posterior part of my forearm. This area also gives me pain when the bump is significant.

Relatively healthy, 5’6, 140lbs. Don’t smoke, drink maybe 1-2x a month. 75mg sertraline daily. Walk 30 mins-1 hour every day. No changes in health. 

With that, I have (undiagnosed?) hypermobile ehler danlos (PCP was not comfortable diagnosing me and preferred a doctor of physical medicine to give it, which I have not yet been to). I have a majority of the symptoms in a beighton test (elastic/velvety skin, atrophic scarring, pinky, thumb, spine). I also have a severe history of knee dislocations and received 7 surgeries during college to help prevent it. 

About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Morton’s neuroma in my left foot. I normally wouldn’t think twice about this, however my PCP was wondering if the swelling in my hand could also be a neuroma..?

Finally, what got me to post here. I recently donated blood and received a letter that my donation tested positive for syphilis. A second test was negative. I recently had an OBGYN appt and do not have syphilis. The letter did say a few things could cause a positive test like infection or potentially an auto immune issue. It made me wonder if something more is connected and I’m focusing on small parts that aren’t adding up.

For now, I wear immobilizing wrist braces at night and whenever the pain/swelling gets too bad. I also do this for my Morton’s neuroma with a boot as recommended by my podiatrist. I am to the point of hopelessness of not knowing what I can do to get rid of it, or at least subside the pain. I have dealt with it for over 6 months and am just looking for some guidance on what kind of provider can help determine some answers. It’s getting to the point where I struggle putting my hair in a ponytail or taking lids off of jars.

I just got the Arctis Nova 1 (wired) headphones and honestly they sound pretty bad. It sounds muffled and the bass is pretty high too. I previously had the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, and I might just not be used to the sound of the headphones. Has anyone had this problem and if so, what do I do? So I’m today years old finding out having a relationship with Jesus is not Biblical? lol. Growing up I was taught to have a relationship with the Lord. Someone told me today that’s not found in scripture, though I kinda see that implied. Oh well. If you’re wanting to lean on Jesus (hope that’s acceptable to say here :) 

Love God with all your heart, mind & soul. Believe in Jesus as Lord and savior. Surrender to him, repent, and include the Lord’s Prayer everyday. Walk with Jesus. Talk to him about anything and everything, He loves us! In my happy place F31.  CANTINA BAND 🎶 | Mephisto Genetics Seed to Harvest Autoflower Grow 🌱💨. Another Seed to Harvest video done!

Need a pair of big non-invasive headphones for my elderly father (80).. (I really don't understand the difference between open back and closed back headphones despite looking it up before adding the flair so i'd say disregard that, I just added it because the side bar says to set flair, just as long as its a non-invasive/earbud type, something to cover his whole ear and block out sound, sorry =b)

My Father suffered a stroke in february and i've become his primary caregiver while he recovers and eveyrthing involved with all that. He enjoys watching youtube a lot and occasionally will put in these tiny cheap earbuds to block out noise, but i'd like to get him something a little more high quality. 

Looking for a good strong headset that is SOFT on the ears and skin, nothing that might put pressure and give him a headache, while also blocking out as much sound as possible. Price is no object but i dont want to be spending anywhere near 1000+ so something within 100-400 range is fine. If anyone is able to help i'd really appreciate listing several options, preferably something we could actually find in a store as he's rather old fashioned and would want to try them on before purchasing. Thank you very much.

 Good, because it’s out of control!! Sara Kern has been dry begging & scamming on Tik Tok since 12-2023! Her lies, manipulations, stories, exaggerations & being the perpetual victim will hopefully be over soon!😎Keep reporting!❤️. They also said if they have backup accounts, they automatically get banned too!!!!!😎👍 I have $60,000 what do I do with it?. I have:   
  
$8000 in credit card debt  
$2000 in a TSFA  
$40,000 in student debt  


I have pretty low income for living on the west coast, only about $2600 monthly, and it's getting tighter by the month...

I have toyed with trying to go into a Master's Program to hopefully make more money in the next 10 years, which would add to the student debt...

I'll never buy a house, because... west coast...

Ultimately, I'd like to travel or do a couple trips, and maybe have a decent retirement plan, even though even that sounds impossible now (I'm 32).

 Imagine if evo vegeta has an active gauge. Upon activation a special cutscene would play where he does the final explosion and reduces own health by 50% (if health is below that it leaves him at 1 hp) and then he can continue the battle but with battle damage due to the final explosion (also it would nullify indestructible and endurance, he’d also go neutral) Why’s my snake sleeping there. He’s got plenty of hiding areas to choose from but he’s just sleeping in the most uncomfortable looking spot Actual fix for AOC Q27G40MXN 180hz 8 bit. Well, this doesn't address the fact that this monitor is most likely limited to displayport 1.2 despite being advertised as 1.4 with 8+2 frc @ 180hz.

It does allow for the full refresh rate and 8 bit. (To me it felt like gsync is smoother, could be placebo) 

Basically, using Custom Resolution Utility, delete the 180hz resolution on the display ID 1.3 extension block.

Then select the 170hz resolution and replace it with 180. Should look like the picture I included. Don't edit the timing type.

Postscript. The Portuguese version will come between tomorrow and Friday  Advice on deck (Mono White Life Gain). Brewing a life gain deck, and this is the decklist I cooked up. Let me know what y'all think. Any advice is appreciated! The deck has a few win-cons but is pretty passive on the board outside of hard life-gain and some pillow-fort interactions. Mainly focusing on things like Approach of the Second Sun and Aetherflux Reservoir, while trying to fall back on cards like Test of Endurance and Felidar Sovereign.

 Celebratory Wine - ready to be part of this year’s exchange!!!. I practiced making hats since last exchange and I can’t wait to be a part of it this year!!! 😍 Almost got Robow and Wildstorm for two dollars.... I went to a local flea market and got all this for 20 dollars. Judging based on what the seller had, there is a very high chance he had Robow and Wildstorm. Meaning I probably could've gotten them for 2 dollars if I arrived sooner to the flea market... I just saw a quick post N delete from a big yb fan page & it’s another surprise coming!.  Thanks to everyone at IU Health hospital. Who were involved with my open umbilical hernia repair with a mesh today! Poached eggs, hollandaise, smoked salmon, a bit of everything is my go to breakfast..  Cloud’s pillow cuddle roll. I have never seen Cloud so happy 🥹❤️ This is genuinely the cutest thing i’ve ever been privileged to witness 😭 Her goofy happy pose gets me everytime 🤣❤️ Budget might eliminate Medicaid for elderly on Medicare. https://x.com/JoanAlker1/status/1925346787864265064

Still early, but this was the first I had heard of it. 21M looking for friends or a chat whatever you want. 



















































Hi I’m looking for quick chats or friends I’m easy going and open minded. Gender also doesn’t matter but please be 18+ Shrooms with my ex pt2. I deleted the first post I made last night because it got popular enough I was worried my ex would see it if he went on Reddit (he’s the one that showed me this subreddit a year or so ago). And I don’t want him to find out my Reddit account and see the breakup word vomit I’ve been posting because it would be very embarrassing. 😅

But I’m the one that was talking about planning a shroom trip during a vacation my ex and I (broke up on Saturday) are going on in a few weeks as friends since we spent a lot of money on everything already. A lot of people think it’s a terrible idea and seem to think I’m like forcing or tricking him to do them with me, but I wanted to update that when he saw that the bags I ordered came in this evening he said that it’s too bad that he has to work tomorrow because we could have taken some tonight.

We’ve done molly in the past when dealing with stuff together, and we literally joke about “doing drugs about it” to fix any problems. It’s just our dynamic I guess, it’s a joke but kind of true as well.

I still want to wait until the vacation though, since it’ll give us like a month to deal with the breakup more and it’ll be in a more neutral place than in the apartment we’ve lived in together for 3.5 years that we will soon be leaving.

Still hoping to find someone that did something similar with an ex and if you guys were able to open up more with each other.

And as before, I’ll keep y’all updated whenever we do take them together! 🫡 Magwells and Basepads. I just bought an Echelon 4.0c. I'm looking for a magwell that will allow me to use the factory Basepads. Does one exist? I'd like to have a magwell that doesn't require me to spend a boatload to use the 5 mags that came with the gun.",0.08640761429120414,610
